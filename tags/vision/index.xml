My advisor, Prof. Ipek Oguz, connected me and my friend, David Lu, with Dr. Nick Kavoussi at VUMC who wanted to bring surgical endoscopy out of the dark ages. With the long-term goal of fully-automated robotic endoscopic surgery, we built a dataset of endoscopic kidney stone removal videos and investigated U-Net, U-Net&#43;&#43;, and DenseNet for the segmentation task. We found a U-Net&#43;&#43; model that consistently achieves &amp;gt;0.9 Dice score, with low loss, and produces realistic, convincing segmentations. Moving forward, I am implementing our model on hardware for deployment in ORs, as a part of my master&amp;rsquo;s thesis, and I helped Dr. Kavoussi submit an R21 grant in October 2021. In the early stages of the project, we were also accepted for a poster presentation at the 2021 Engineering &amp;amp; Urology Society annual meeting.

Abstract Image segmentation has been increasingly applied in medical settings as recent developments have skyrocketed the potential applications of deep learning. Urology, specifically, is one field of medicine that is primed for the adoption of a real-time image segmentation system with the long-term aim of automating endoscopic stone treatment. In this project, we explored supervised deep learning models to annotate kidney stones in surgical endoscopic video feeds. In this paper, we describe how we built a dataset from the raw videos and how we developed a pipeline to automate as much of the process as possible. For the segmentation task, we adapted and analyzed three baseline deep learning models – U-Net, U-Net&#43;&#43;, and DenseNet – to predict annotations on the frames of the endoscopic videos with the highest accuracy above 90%. To show clinical potential for real-time use, we also confirmed that our best trained model can accurately annotate new videos at 30 frames per second. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method justifies continued development and study of image segmentation to annotate ureteroscopic video feeds.
Results  Figure 1. A comparison of vanilla (V) and pretrained (P) model training accuracies. Vanilla U-Net and U-Net&#43;&#43; start at a lower accuracy of approximately 0.75 Dice and gradually converge to a Dice score of approximately 0.88. ImageNet- pretrained U-Net and U-Net&#43;&#43; start at approximately 0.85 Dice, the convergence of the vanilla versions, and converge to about 0.91 and 0.92 Dice, respectively.    Figure 2. A comparison of our best models’ Dice score (left) and BCE loss (right) from training. Note that the y-axis is scaled to the range of values. DenseNet had the highest and most variant BCE loss, yet its outlier values are relatively low compared to those in other binary classification tasks as BCE does not have an upper bound.    Figure 3. Sample frame from the side-by-side video reconstruction of the input, ground truth, automated prediction with U-Net&#43;&#43;, and heat map (left to right). The heat map is the raw probability output per pixel whereas the predicted segmentation is the pixels with probabilities ≥ 0.5. The model was able to compute this output at 30 FPS.     Table 1. Summary of the statistics gathered for each model. Non-parenthetical values are the average scores from all frames in the test set. The reported value in parentheses is the maximum value recorded from each baseline’s validation during training. The highest performances between models for each metric are denoted in bold. U-Net&#43;&#43; claimed the highest scores in each metric on the test set. U-Net had the same test Dice score as U-Net&#43;&#43; but lower scores in all other metrics. DenseNet had relatively poor performance for all metrics. Only the ROC curves from test set performances are included.    Video 1. Example performance video of our best U-Net&#43;&#43; video on new data, not in train / val / test sets. The video shows a saline treatment and a stone that is being broken down with a laser. Detritus from the laser treatment is collecting to the left of the stone. This video is a typical example of what the model would see in a practical setting.   Future To deploy our high-performing model for surgical use in operating rooms, we will extend our video processing script to receive “in-step” frame-by-frame video input from a video capture card connected via DVI/HDMI to the endoscopic hardware. Then, we will output the side-by-side frames, as in Figure 5, to an adjacent monitor to assist physicians in surgery. Developing such a system will allow us to investigate further goals, such as monocular depth prediction which might prove critical in automation.18
We will also investigate the application of temporal models for our system. Incorporating information from previous frames might allow for more consistent prediction between subsequent frames. In addition, such models account for memory of data from previous frames without the overhead of additional input dimensions suffered by our current fully convolutional models. For this task, we will incorporate self-attention modules into our U-Net and U-Net&#43;&#43; architectures, which has been shown to increase performance in video segmentation.19
In practice, the problem domain also requires the segmentation of kidney stones after they have been surgically broken down into smaller pieces. The current dataset has been developed to support the segmentation of only whole kidney stones. Further development will include expansion of another section of the dataset where, as a surgeon breaks stones apart, the debris fragments will still be labeled by our model. In Figure 5, our model already segments clumps of debris; however, our future goal is finer granularity via an instance segmentation method.20
Additionally, we plan to incorporate multi-class segmentation to also identify, for example, healthy vs. un- healthy tissue. Since the task performs well on stone segmentation, we hypothesize that we can utilize the same underlying architectures to adapt to multi-class segmentation and that the model will perform similarly well, with relatively few manually annotated examples.21
