      <content:encoded><![CDATA[tl;dr This Fall 2021, I am taking a course on computational game theory, which insofar is the formulation of various games (e.g. bimatrix, Stackelberg) as mathematical programs and the algorithms that solve them, or approximate solutions. Linear complementarity problems are foundational for computing Nash equilibria of simple games.
Background Programming A mathematical program is an optimization (min, max) over an objective function and constraints. A linear program (LP) is one where the objective function and the constraints are all linear.
 The general LP formulation.  Aside: The terms &amp;lsquo;argmin&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;argmax&amp;rsquo; are special terminology for returning the optimizing value of the argument, instead of the optimal value of the function.
Complementarity A complementarity condition is a special kind of constraint required for solving linear complementarity problems (LCPs), as the name suggests. The non-negative vectors x and y are complements if one or both of the values at corresponding indices are 0.
 The definition of complementarity.  Complementarity results from a program&amp;rsquo;s transformation into an LCP. Generally, it is not a constraint defined in the programs of the game.
Games &amp;amp; Equilibria Intuitively, games are multiple programs that relate to each other. An equilibrium is a simultaneous joint solution that solves all optimization problems in a game.
In Nash games, it is assumed that the opponent will always play their optimal move, so the player should always play their optimal move. A Nash equilibrium is a best player&amp;rsquo;s best move without deviating from their predefined strategy, i.e., a matrix of costs for each of the player&amp;rsquo;s moves against each of the opponent&amp;rsquo;s moves. Solving Nash games is the same as finding the Nash equilibria.
Aside: John Nash proved that in every finite game all players can arrive at an optimal outcome.
Linear Complementarity Problem An LCP is defined as:
 The general form of an LCP.  LCPs are important and useful, for both mathematical and computer, programming because they can be analytically and algorithmically solved. Therefore, any programs that can be transformed into an LCP can be solved through the LCP; for Nash games, solutions to the LCP are thus the Nash equilibria.
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker Conditions The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are a set of first-order conditions using a program&amp;rsquo;s objective function and constraints that must be satisfied by any optima. For the general form of a program:
 The general form of a mathematical program.  The KKT conditions are defined as:
 The KKT conditions for a general program.  The KKT conditions of the programs in a Nash game can be composed into an LCP. Solutions to the LCP satisfy the KKT conditions and are therefore Nash equilibria and solutions to the game.
For the linear program above, the KKT conditions are:
 The KKT conditions for a linear program.  which can then be composed into a function of the following form:
 The KKT conditions as a function for an LCP.  Complementarity conditions can then be enforced over this function of KKT conditions to form an LCP. Voilà!
Other programs, e.g., quadratic programs (QPs), can also be massaged into LCPs by stacking their KKT conditions in this way. Some problems can be massaged into complementarity problems, but not necessarily LCPs. Amusingly, the solutions to those problems are often approximated by solving LCPs.
Lemke&amp;rsquo;s Method Lemke&amp;rsquo;s method is a pivoting algorithm for computationally finding solutions to LCPs. The rearranged equation above can be organized into a tableau of the form:
 The tableau to solve the LCP via Lemke&#39;s method.  You may already see that essentially finding solutions to the LCP is solving a system of equations. However, since the tableau is a wide matrix, the system is underdetermined so there are infinitely many solutions, i.e., they lie in a conic region defined by complementary pairs of columns in the tableau, or no solutions, i.e., if q is not contained in any complementary cone.
For n variables in the z vector, there are necessarily 2n columns in the tableau with the n slack variables for w. Because of the stacked KKT conditions in the function, there are n rows. This suggests that any n of the variables, defined by their corresponding columns, can form a basis B to define the conic region containing a feasible solution. The decomposition of the system into basis and non-basis parts:
 The decomposition of an undetermined system into basis and non-basis components.  Since B is a basis of linearly independent columns, it can be inverted and the basis variables can technically determined that way. However, these matrices can be enormous in practice and inverting a matrix is very computationally expensive. Thankfully, iteratively pivoting the tableau is one way to accomplish the same goal without ever needing to invert a giant matrix. The high-level steps are:
 Use a minimum ratio test to determine the exiting variable from the basis. Row-reduce the tableau along the pivot column that corresponds to the entering variable at the row index of the exiting variable s.t. the pivot column is now one-hot at that row index. Replace the exiting variable with the entering variable at its index in the basis vector. The next entering variable is the complementary variable to the exiting variable, i.e., w_i -&amp;gt; z_i.  Stop conditions for the algorithm typically include: the values in the pivot columns are out of bounds, i.e., z_i &amp;lt; 0, or the initial entering variable z_0 leaves the basis. At the end of the algorithm, the values in the column corresponding to q will be the values of the basis variables in the final basis, and their complements will be 0. There are a number of modifications and tricks on top of this basic scaffolding that have been developed to handle variant complementarity problems. For discussion of each variant of Lemke&amp;rsquo;s method and their implementation details, I suggest reading Chapter 2 of the Murty textbook.
Other Complementarity Problems &amp;amp; Applications LCPs are in fact a very specific formulation of complementarity problems and generalizations exist, e.g., nonlinear (NCP), linear mixed (LMCP), and mixed (MCP) complementarity problems, which have looser constraints than an LCP. However, these problems typically cannot be analytically solved like LCPs, but can be approximated by LCPs.
Solving games underlies many practical applications, ranging from hot topics, such as autonomous driving and reinforcement learning, to age-old games, i.e., tag, motion planning, i.e., approximating MCPs with the PATH solver, and physics simulations.

Motivation Following my quad build experience, I set the intention to continue working with and learning more about quads. Whereas in that project I focused more on the hardware side of quads, I wanted to focus more on the software side in this one. Specifically, I wanted to program a quad with autonomous functionality. While working on the quad build, I stumbled upon face detection &amp;amp; following and SLAM. Face detection &amp;amp; following is straightforward: use deep learning to draw a bounding box around faces in the image and compute the direction to travel based on the size and offset from the image&amp;rsquo;s center. vSLAM on the other hand is more interesting in my opinion. For those that don&amp;rsquo;t know: simultaneous localization &amp;amp; mapping (SLAM) uses sensor data, i.e., lidar, radar, camera, etc., to create a map and track the location(s) of the agent(s) on the map. This problem is intractable and elegantly implementing it in the field is a unique challenge, often requiring a team with intimate knowledge of the UAV to tailor clever SLAM algorithms to it.
Contents  main.m: control flow script to demonstrate each of these on the Tello. follow.m: face detection and following algorithm that returns the movement vector required to center the drone on the detected face, if there is one. vslam.m: implements vSLAM using the drone&amp;rsquo;s pinhole camera given a predetermined movement sequence that should be cycled a handful of times.  Method Face Following Algorithm:
 Pass the frame to the object detector and retrieve a bounding box location(s) for the detected object. Draw boxes around all of the detected images. Use the closest bounding box’s width and center coordinates to compute the relative axis change as a percentage of the max. Based on some threshold percentage and some minimum movement distance, set the axes distances and return them to be used in a move command.    Fig 1. Face following schematic. An image is passed to the cascade object detector. The detector draws a bounding box around the face. The centering vector from the current center to the center of the bounding box is computed. The UAV moves in the direction of the centering vector while maintaining a safe, specified distance.  vSLAM This vSLAM implementation breaks down into three key parts: map initialization, tracking and local mapping.
Starting with map initialization, the steps are as follows:
 Track the ORB features on the first image to load the pre-points, then track a second image. Match the ORB feature correspondences between the two images. If enough matches are made (100), compute the homography and fundamental matrices so that the correct geometric transform is applied based on which results in the least error for the relative camera pose. If insufficient matches are made, then the loop restarts on a new image. Manually, the loop has a maximum of 5 iterations to find a matched image until an error is thrown. If a match is not made in 5 iterations, it may imply that the Tello has weak connection and low light and needs to be reset. Triangulate the 3D locations of the matched features in the new map.  For tracking:
 Move the drone according to the modulus of the current move index by the length of the move sequence. If the Tello loses connection and throws an error, loop back to see if connection is regained, changing no indices except a break iteration countdown of 10. Throw the error if the break countdown expires. Extract ORB features from the frame and match with the latest keyframe. If the new frame is not a keyframe, continue the loop. Estimate the camera pose with Perspective-n-Point [10] in order to project the features to the current frames perspective and correct using some bundle adjustments[8]. This step, although esoteric, is important for the fast computation of that ORB-SLAM offers compared to the competition. Determine if the current frame is a key frame given the criteria. If so, the process continues to local mapping. Else, the loop iterates, and the above steps are redone for the next frame. Additionally, this step also speeds up the process; instead of evaluating all of the features in every frame for mapping, only a select few that are substantially different are filtered for usage.  The local mapping steps are as follows:
 Add the new keyframe to the set. Compare the keyframes features against all the other keyframe features, looking for unmatched points that occur in at least 3 other keyframes. Bundle adjust the pose based on the adjacent keyframes’ poses.   Fig 2. Visual ORB-SLAM schematic. The process starts by initializing the map with two initial frames from the camera. During the initialization the UAV jiggles up and down to snapshot slightly different pairs of images with different feature extractions but still with some matches. If the map initializes, then the program proceeds to the main loop where it first tracks the features on a new frame. If the frame is a keyframe, then the new features are updated into the map. If the frame is not a keyframe, then the loop continues. At the start of each loop iteration, the UAV executes the next move in the sequence.  Results Face Following   Fig 3. Examples of when my face is detected. Looking at the Tello (left) and not looking at the Tello (right). Nonetheless, it still detects my face and doesn’t pick up much noise, even in low light.     Fig 4. Example of face misclassification. These misclassifications typically occur when there is no face in view of the camera. Otherwise, they are rare and not noticeable during a face following run.   Face following was easy to implement. The ony hindrance was the occasional misclassification confusing the Tello, causing it to align with that &amp;ldquo;face&amp;rdquo;. You can see from these face detection frames that a bounding box was computed. From here, the distance to the target can be inferred from the area of the bounding box and the alignment offset can be inferred from the bounding box center&amp;rsquo;s distance from the frame&amp;rsquo;s center.
vSLAM   Fig 5. Example of a map initialization feature match. Typically, the map initialized and I could get a sense of where the features were.     Fig 6. Examples of good (left) and average (right) feature extraction. Often times, the good initial feature extractions really set the momentum for how the rest of the main loop would turn out. Notice that the busier nearby area with more edges acquires more features.     Fig 7. Examples of map plots and estimated trajectories and camera pose. Both of the movement sequences were left and right images and that the number on the camera indicates that there were 10 keyframes in this vSLAM run.  vSLAM was a much harder task to get right. One crux of the system was the speed at which the Tello captured frames; for vSLAM to work well, frames need to be captured in quick succession, with very slight movements. Precisely moving the Tello proved to be very challenging with the MATLAB toolkit, plus an indoor environment where the Tello&amp;rsquo;s own gusts reflecting off of hard surfaces would significantly alter its course. Regardless, the system was still able to generate a point cloud and update location within the map.
Future  Streamline main.m with user input to guide the program and improve the functionality of vslam.m as best I can for Tello. Implement general object detection alongside the face detection pipeline. Add autonomous movement based on point cloud &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; remove need for a predetermined path. The implementations here are stepping stones to some more intelligent autonomous UAV behavior. I have the idea that I&amp;rsquo;ll implemennt path planning on a Tello as well. Once I have that, I may integrate these three features into a Tello hide-n-seek project.  References Papers P. Viola and M.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[ My fully built quadcopter on the ground, not flying... yet.  tl;dr My introduction to quadcopters and robotics in which I learned a lot about the quad ecosystem and their constitution. However, I suggest following a smaller, cheaper, and more recent build guide. Although my naivete showed through here, my fascination with quads has not soured; check out my Tello face following and vSLAM project!
Motivation As much as I like software, I also like hardware. I quickly realized that pure computer science wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to expose me to much hardware so I took it upon myself in summer 2020 &amp;ndash; mid-quarantine &amp;ndash; to teach myself. At the time, I was stumbling down a rabbit hole and obsessing over quadcopters, yet I had never laid my hands on one. To me at the time, building a quad from parts was as good a place to start as any.
Cost To make the journey as painless as possible, I followed a build from a $15 Udemy course that was apparently not a moneymaker because it is no longer listed. The build that I followed was not current; the drone industry moves fast and parts will shift in and out of compatibility. You can find potentially better, much cheaper, sufficiently thorough builds on YouTube. The community is dedicated so up-to-date build guides are very likely.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t need tools, then this build is approx $500. Again, there are budget drone builds, that are current and probably more satisfying &amp;ndash; don&amp;rsquo;t reinvent the wheel. Or, you could buy a $100 Tello and program the hell out of it.

Lessons Building a drone is easy, getting it to fly is hard. Soldering, plugging, and fixing hardware to the frame is like legos. Flashing the flight OS onto the Raspberry Pi &#43; Navio2 flight controller is no problem. Finding a functioning ground control software from this century = yikes. Then you just have to pray that it&amp;rsquo;s compatible with your flight controller.
On a side note, this drone is deceptively big. Although I&amp;rsquo;m not an expert aerospace engineer, I deduce that getting big things to fly is much more of a hassle than for small things, especially if you live in an apartment in the city.
One super fun takeaway: learning how components connect to the whole quad, how they communicate with each other, and how a full-fledged cyberphysical system can come together was extremely rewarding.
Large quad with exposed wires and point ends = the ultimate cat chew-toy
Future Off and on, I may try to get this quad flying. However, it will likely remain a trophy of my first foray into quads, and also a testament to my initial learning curve. As I&amp;rsquo;ve hinted at many times, I soon intend to follow a smaller, cheaper build. Most importantly, I&amp;rsquo;m excited to take what I learned here and apply it broadly to other hardware projects.
