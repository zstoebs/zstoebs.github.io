      <content:encoded><![CDATA[tl;dr After brief description of diffusion tensor images and what information they provide, I discuss an intuitive seed-based line propagation algorithm for computing a tractography map of a neuroimage. A stack of open-source softwares that can be used to implement diffusion tensor tractography are 3D Slicer, ITK for C&#43;&#43;, and ITK-SNAP.
The diffusion tensor image used to generate all figures is publically available as sample data, DTIBrain, via 3D Slicer.
Diffusion Tensor Imaging In a diffusion tensor image (DTI), each voxel is represented by a symmetric tensor with 6 distinct values for the speed of water diffusion, corresponding to the directions from the center of the cubic voxel to each of its faces. Without obstruction, water diffusion is uniform on average in every direction; however, in spaces that alter diffusion, the values in each of these directions are anisotropic. Anisotropic diffusion gives rise to a principal axis of diffusion where some forward and backwards direction have greater values than the rest. Hence, the tensor at the voxel can be visualized as an ellipsoid – the elastic deformation of the cube along the principal axis.
Sagittal slice of a DTI. 3D Slicer visualizes DTI well with a color orientation scheme, where red means that the principal eigenvector is along the left-right axis, blue means its along the inferior-superior axis, and green means its along the anterior-posterior axis. Intermediate colors means that its along a linear combination of these basis vectors. Principal Eigenvector The major eigenvector from each diffusion tensor gives the forward direction of the principal axis; the negation of the major eigenvector is the backwards direction. Precomputing this vector image, with one vector at each voxel, yields a map that can be used to route the line propagation algorithm through the brain&amp;rsquo;s tracts. ITK defines a DiffusionTensor3D type that can set as the pixel type for an image; the type also defines a function for computing its eigendecomposition, which can be called when the pixel is accessed by an iterator.
Sagittal slice of the principal eigenvector image of the DTI. Although it&#39;s noisy, you can see that there is still structure to it that makes sense, i.e., in the corpus callosum and the brain stem. Fractional Anisotropy Fractional anisotropy (FA) is a scalar value computed from the eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor to quantify the amount of anisotropic diffusion at a voxel in the DTI [3]. A high value insinuates that water diffuses along a single axis, which would correspond to water flowing through a tract. FA for a 3x3 diffusion tensor is computed as follows:
The formula to compute the scalar FA value, which is solely based on the eigenvalues, where the capped lambda is the mean of the eigenvalues. When performing tractography, an FA value that is too low implies that water diffusion is largely isotropic, e.g., in grey matter, where there are no tracts. Hence, a minimum FA can be set and used as a stopping condition at a given voxel. ITK&amp;rsquo;s DiffusionTensor3D type defines a function to compute the FA value of the tensor and can be accessed in the same way as the eigendecomposition function.
Sagittal slice of the FA image of the DTI. The FA image looks strikingly similar to a structural MRI. Tractography With the directional values, a line can be propagated from a seed voxel along the 3D vector field to reconstruct a 3D tract down the two directions of the principal axis [1]. By propagating a line from a seed, or from many seeds, a rudimentary tractography map of a DTI can be computed. Although line propagation is intuitive and relatively lightweight, it is worth noting that other fiber tracking techniques exist that are both more robust and more intensive [2].
The stopping conditions:
Current iteration is greater than the max number of iterations chosen by the user. The candidate voxel is outside of the image. The FA at the candidate voxel is below the minimum FA acceptable chosen by the user. The candidate voxel has already been visited. If no stopping condition was met, then the current voxel was visited, meaning:
The candidate voxel in the tractography image was set to a non-negative integer. The eigenvector at the candidate voxel was extracted, multiplied by some step size ∆ chosen by the user, added and subtracted from the candidate voxel’s index, and then pushed to the back of the list. Finally, the candidate voxel was popped from the front of the list and the iteration was incremented. For this task, line propagation can be implemented both iteratively or recursively because it is isomorphic to search algorithms, i.e., breadth-first and depth-first search. Switching between the two is pretty straightforward as the function definitions should not be very different. That said, the recursive algorithm is likely less bloated and more effective computationally, but might be much slower if you&amp;rsquo;re using ITK in Python rather than C&#43;&#43;.
Views of a tractography image generated by a single seed (top) and multiple seeds from a segmentation image (bottom) for ∆ = 0.9, minimum FA at 0.1, and the maximum number of iterations at 10000. The orientation of the views is given on the top. As expected, multi-seed input generated a much more extensive tractography map. References [1] Mori S, van Zijl PC.

Abstract The striatum has traditionally been the focus of Huntington’s disease research due to the primary insult to this region and its central role in motor symptoms. Beyond the striatum, evidence of cortical alterations caused by Huntington’s disease has surfaced. However, findings are not coherent between studies which have used cortical thickness for Huntington’s disease since it is the well-established cortical metric of interest in other diseases. In this study, we propose a more comprehensive approach to cortical morphology in Huntington’s disease using cortical thickness, sulcal depth, and local gyrification index. Our results show consistency with prior findings in cortical thickness, including its limitations. Our comparison between cortical thickness and local gyrification index underscores the complementary nature of these two measures &amp;ndash; cortical thickness detects changes in the sensorimotor and posterior areas while local gyrification index identifies insular differences. Since local gyrification index and cortical thickness measures detect changes in different regions, the two used in tandem could provide a clinically relevant measure of disease progression. Our findings suggest that differences in insular regions may correspond to earlier neurodegeneration and may provide a complementary cortical measure for detection of subtle early cortical changes due to Huntington’s disease.
Results CT Fig 1. Omnibus test results for CT showing the regions of significant contrast across all patients compared to controls. P-values were adjusted for FWER using random field theory (\alpha=0.01). SD Fig 2. Omnibus test results for SD showing the regions of significant contrast across all patients compared to controls. P-values were adjusted for FWER using random field theory (\alpha=0.01). LGI Fig 3. Omnibus test results for LGI showing the regions of significant contrast across all patients compared to controls. P-values were adjusted for FWER using random field theory (\alpha=0.01). Summary Table 1. Summary of Regions with Significant Changes Per Feature. The percentage of the structure with significant changes are reported, in terms of the number of vertices. Regions are color-coded according to cooccurrence in the three features. Red = regional changes were detected by all three features. Yellow = regional changes were detected by two of the features. Blue = regional changes were detected by one of the features. Takeaways A main takeaway was learning the scientific process in action and, most importantly, learning to work with more experienced researchers. I wrote the code and performed all of the analysis that produced our results. However, I did not develop the awesome acquisition method that generated our LGI data nor the statistical theory behind the analysis. Throughout the project, I have relied heavily on the expertise of my co-authors &amp;ndash; all of whom have PhDs whereas I was an undergrad until recently. This first journey in research has been inspiring and indelible. I am beyond grateful for it!

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[ A shallow autoencoder&#39;s projection of 53-dimensional vectors to 3 dimensions. tl;dr I fell in love with dimensionality reduction when I was learning statistical ML. Since I also study neuroscience, I wanted to practice the art at the intersection of my interests. I compared the 3D projections of a 53-dimensional neurophysiology dataset produced by PCA and a shallow autoencoder.

Motivation As I began learning about ML and statistical ML in particular, I became fascinated by dimensionality reduction (DR) methods. For those that don&amp;rsquo;t know, DRs project data from a high-dimensional space to a low-dimensional space. In essence, they are generalizations of the vector projection methods onto the x-, y-, and z-axes taught in a multivariable calculus course. DR is akin to conventional information compression, trading off size for information loss so choosing the best method and lower dimension is as much art as it is strategy.
Content I used this project to put fingers to keyboard and learn through implementation. I explored two avenues, applying
PCA An autoencoder to a waveform-to-cell type classification problem.
PCA is the OG DR method. It decomposes the covariance matrix of the dataset to discover components that explain the most variance of the dataset. Then, the dataset is projected onto these components, which often times could .
Autoencoders (AEs) are a deep neural network (DNN) that learns to encode examples in a dataset to a lower dimensional latent vector and then decode the latent vector back to the original example. Usually, AEs learn to project examples to a manifold, i.e., they are non-linear DR methods.
Essentially, this project compares linear vs. non-linear DR.
Method Dataset The dataset and article Sofroniew, Nicholas James et al. “Neural coding in barrel cortex during whisker-guided locomotion.” can be found on the author&amp;rsquo;s GitHub repo. Of the 16,000 recorded neurons, approx. 30 neurons were recorded for each of 13 subjects. Each recording was comprised of 53 voltage measurements. Overall, the dataset is composed of 302 waveforms. Unavoidably, the dataset is unbalanced; regular spikers comprise 247 of the examples while intermediate spikers only make up 4 examples.
Figure 1. Summary of the waveforms with mean waveform (left) and waveform distributions by cell type (right). Note that the mean waveform is essentially the tightly bounded waveform distribution for regular spikers, which dominate the dataset. Classification To compare and contrast the baseline, PCA, and autoencoding, I implemented a KNN classifier that uses Euclidean distance and majority vote for classification. To find the best number of neighbors given the dataset, I ran it through a standard hyperparameter search using cross-validation and a stratified split of the dataset to mitigate unbalanced classes. Once a good k-value was found, I evaluated the model on the test set, as well as a reclassification of the training set for debugging purposes.
Results The experiments for PCA and autoencoding had the same structure: 1. find the best reduced dimensionality, 2. reduce the dataset, and 3. test with KNN.
Figure 2. Scree plot (left) and cumulative explained variance of the first N components (right) from PCA applied to the waveforms. Table 1. Baseline results for a KNN fit on 53-dimensional waveform feature vectors. Table 2. PCA results for a KNN fit on 3- dimensional waveform components. Figure 3. 3D spatial distribution of the waveform principal components from PCA. Table 3. Autoencoding results for a KNN fit on 3-dimensional waveform components. Figure 4. 3D spatial distribution of the encodings from the bottleneck layer of the autoencoder. For both PCA and autoencoding, the accuracy is only slightly worse than that of the baseline. For PCA, the test accuracy is exactly the same for the 3 seeds while for the autoencoder it is only slightly worse. On the other hand, for the debug accuracy, PCA performs worse than the baseline while the autoencoder performs better. Given that trend, it might suggest that the autoencoder is somewhat overfitting the dataset, diminishing its generalizability. However, the test accuracy suggests that it is not significantly detrimental. All in all, dimensionality reduction still yields data suitable for high performance, even with information loss.
Future PCA is a fixed method but AEs are newer and more flexible. A whole study could be done just exploring AE architectures that yield the best projection for this classification task, not to mention other relevant tasks. Of course, other non-DNN non-linear DR methods could be applied to this dataset, which would be particularly interesting for the classification of waveform to subject. Perhaps one of those methods or an AE would be able to adequately separate these classes, which were not easily separable by PCA when I tried.
