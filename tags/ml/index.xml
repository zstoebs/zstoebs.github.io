      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Preconditioning adjusts the state of a model to {expedite, improve, stabilize} convergence of an optimization procedure, typically by adjusting the gradient in the update rule with the inverse of the Hessian or improving the condition number of a matrix whose spectrum affects convergence. For the following problems, we are solving $\min_x \frac{1}{2}||Ax-b||_2^2$ for positive definite $A$ where $\kappa (A)$ is large.
Newton method This is a root-finding method for a convex function based on its linear approximation (first-order definition of convexity):
A function is convex if $\forall x,y \in D(f)$:
$$ f(y) \leq f(x) + \partial f(x)^T (y-x) $$which implies every tangent line of $f$ is below the function. Therefore, if the tangent line intercepts the domain at $y$ then:
$$ \partial f(x) = \frac{f(x) - 0}{x - y} \implies y = x - (\partial f(x))^{-1} f(x) $$Rewriting this as an iterative scheme:
$$ x_{n+1} = x_n - (\partial f(x_n))^{-1} f(x_n) $$In the context of finding minima with gradient descent (assuming f is twice differentiable), the Newton update is:
$$ x_{n+1} = x_n - (\partial^2 f(x_n))^{-1} \partial f(x_n) $$Note that for differentiable scalar-valued functions $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \implies \partial f(x) = \nabla f(x)$ (the subdifferential equals the gradient) and for vector-valued functions $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m \implies \partial f(x) = J_f (x)$ (the subdifferential equals the Jacobian).
Figure 1. Convergence of Newton's method vs gradient descent on different plots. Newton's method convergences more quickly and closely to the solution than gradient descent when the problem is poorly conditioned. Quasi-Newton method For multivariate, high-dimensional regimes, computing the Hessian, Jacobian, etc. can be expensive $\mathcal{O} (mn)$, which implies its an order higher to compute the inverse $\mathcal{O} (n^3)$. Quasi-Newton methods accelerate this procedure with iterative updates to an approximation of the inverse Hessian and one of the most renowned is the BFGS method &ndash; named after Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb, and Shanno &ndash; which is implemented in this example.
How do we derive a good approximate of the Hessian?
Similar to Newton&rsquo;s method, we start from the second-order approximation of a convex function:
$$ f(y) \leq f(x) + \partial f(x)^T (y-x) + \frac{1}{2} (y-x)^T B (y-x) $$If $y=x_k + \Delta x$ and we take the gradient w.r.t. $\Delta x$, we get the secant equation:
$$ \partial f(x_k + \Delta x) \leq \partial f(x_k) + B \Delta x $$If we set it to 0: $$ \Delta x = -B^{-1} \partial f(x_k) $$which implies the Newton step so this is consistent if B is the Hessian.
The secant equation is a line in the function&rsquo;s gradient space that can be used as a condition for each update of the Hessian. How this secant equation is solved is what sets different quasi-Newton methods apart. In BFGS, the quasi-Newton condition is:
$$ B_{k+1} (x_{k+1} - x_k) = \nabla f(x_{k+1}) - \nabla f(x_k) $$First, we set $B_0 = \beta I$ where $\beta > 0$ is hyperparameter ensuring that we start with a positive-definite matrix and choose step size $\alpha_k$ with an exact line search adhering to the Wolfe conditions which are:
$$ \begin{align} f(x_k + \alpha_k p_k) &\leq f(x_k) + c_1 \alpha_k p_k^T \nabla f(x_k) \\\ p_k^T \nabla f(x_k + \alpha_k p_k) &\geq c_2 p_k^T \nabla f(x_k) \end{align} $$Then our update rule is:
$$ x_{k+1} = x_k - \alpha_k B^{-1}_k \partial f(x_k) $$Using only the known terms in the current update and the gradient at the new iterate $\partial f(x_{k+1})$, we can update the Hessian $B_k$ with Broyden&rsquo;s method or directly update the inverse Hessian $B_k^{-1}$ with the Sherman-Morrison formula.
The algorithm steps are as follows:
Obtain direction $p_k = -B^{-1}_k \nabla f(x_k)$ Perform a line search on $\alpha_k$ until the Wolfe conditions on the current iterates are satisfied Set $s_k = \alpha_k p_k$, $x_{k+1} = x_k + s_k$, and $y_k = \nabla f(x_{k+1}) - \nabla f(x_k)$ Update inverse Hessian approximation with the SM formula. Let $H_k = B^{-1}_k, \rho = s_K^T y_k$, then: $$ H_{k+1} = H_k + \frac{(\rho + y_k^T H_k y_k)(s_k s_k^T)}{\rho^2} - \frac{H_k y_k s_k^T + s_k y_k^T H_k}{\rho} $$Note that an approximation of theoretic preconditioners does change the geometry of the problem so the true optimum is technically different. The idea is to ensure an good approximation that makes the change negligible.
Figure 2. Convergence of Newton's method vs gradient descent on different plots. Newton's method convergences more quickly to the solution than gradient descent or BFGS but BFGS converges substantially better and faster than gradient descent when the problem is poorly conditioned. Conjugate Gradient Conjugate gradient (CG) minimizes the quadratic:
$$ f(x) = b^T x - \frac{1}{2} x^T A x $$where $A$ is positive definite.
Note that the residual norm $||b-Ax||$ is not necessarily monotonically decreasing since $||b-Ax||^2 = x^T A^T A x - 2 b^T Ax + b^T b$ differs from the objective.
If $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ then CG takes at most $n$ iterations to converge by updating $x_k$ along directions $p_k$ which are conjugate w.r.t. $A$. That is:
$$ x_{k+1} = x_k + \alpha_k p_k $$where $p_i^T A p_j = 0$ for $i \neq j$. This implies that $\\{p_1, ..., p_n\\}$ for a basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$ so we can express $ x^* $ as a linear combination of the conjugate directions, i.e., $x^* = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i p_i$ which is equivalent to taking n steps along orthogonal conjugate directions. We can solve for the exact $\alpha_k$ assuming we have access to all $p_k$. However, for large $A$, finding n conjugate directions is intractable.
An important result for iteratively computing $\alpha_k$ and $p_k$ for CG is that the Krylov sequence induced by $A$ implies that $span \\{r_0,...,r_k \\} = span\\{r_0,...,A^k r_0\\} = span\\{p_0,...,p_k\\} \subset span\\{p_0,...,p_k,...,p_n\\}$ where $r_k = \nabla f(x_k) = b - Ax_k$. Therefore, $\alpha_k$ and $p_k$ can be written in terms of the residual $r_k$ at each iteration. Then the update rules are:
$$ \begin{align} p_0 &= r_0 = b \\\ \alpha_k &= \frac{r_k^T r_k}{p_k^T A p_k} \\\ r_{k+1} &= r_k - \alpha_k A p_k \\\ p_{k+1} &= r_k + \frac{r_{k+1}^T r_{k+1}}{r_k^T r_k} p_k \end{align} $$Take a look at Boyd&rsquo;s notes on CG for more explanation.
Preconditioned CG The convergence of iterative methods depends on the spectral properties of the system matrix $A$. If $A$ is poorly conditioned, then method will take longer to converge. The condition number for any matrix $A$ is defined as:
$$ \begin{align} \kappa(A) &= ||A|| \\\ ||A^{-1}|| &= \frac{\sigma_{max}(A)}{\sigma_{min}(A)} \end{align} $$Therefore, $\kappa(A) \geq 1$ where $\kappa(A) = 1$ is the best conditioning. To precondition CG, we want to find a matrix $M$ s.t. $M^{-1} A \approx 1$ or at least $\kappa(M^{-1} A) < \kappa(A)$.
Designing $M$ depends on $A$. If $A$ is diagonal or diagonally dominant, then a simple Jacobi preconditioner typically suffices. A more robust method is using incomplete Cholesky factorization to tractably design a matrix from lower trianglular matrices that improves the problem&rsquo;s conditioning or using Chebyshev polynomials.
With the preconditioner, we want to solve the equivalent system:
$$ \hat{A} \hat{x} = \hat{b} \text{ where } M=LL^T, \hat{A} = L^{-1} A L^{-T}, \hat{x} = L^T x, \hat{b} = L^{-1} b $$This results in an extra step of finding $z_k$ s.t. $M z_k = r_k$, which adjusts the updates:
$$ \begin{align} \alpha_k &= \frac{r_k^T z_k}{p_k^T A p_k} \\\ p_{k+1} &= r_k + \frac{r_{k+1}^T z_{k+1}}{r_k^T z_k} p_k \end{align} $$Here are some good notes on preconditioning CG.
Figure 3. Convergence of vanilla conjugate gradient vs preconditioned conjugate gradient. Preconditioning leads to iterates that are closer to the solution. For high-dimensional problems where $n$ is very large, preconditioning is necessary to approximate a close-enough solution in a reasonable amount of time. ]]></content:encoded>

Background Although autonomous vehicles are the talk of the town these days, the methodologies behind them are elusive to most. To help yourself, I suggest reading my note on LCPs and then follow that up with section 3.1 of this thesis on LMCPs and the path solver for MCPs.
Path planning in autonomous vehicles is a booming research area with significant developments. Although computer vision and machine learning are often employed to plan motion in autonomous vehicles, computationally solving the optimization problems, that arise from in scenarios of motion planning, through a game theoretic is a lightweight alternative to path solving. In this scenario, the path planning optimization problem is formulated as a nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) constrained by physics and simple car dynamics, which cannot necessarily be directly and exactly solved. Instead the NCP can be approximated by linear mixed complementarity problems (LMCPs), iteratively computing partial paths that together approximate the solution to the NCP and yield a motion planned trajectory for an autonomous vehicle.
The problem formulation is a non-visual scenario where stationary obstacles are laid out on a grid, in a predetermined fashion, and an optimal path must be computed through these obstacles to some goal point without exceeding bounds. Such paths are often nonlinear and can be closely approximated by solving linear mixed complementarity problems via a pathsolver algorithm. Once the path is determined, the JetBot must then move in a real setting, of which the software representation of the grid space is a projection.
Building the JetBot The JetBot was built following the documentation on the JetBot homepage. For the parts with multiple options: the IMX219-160 listed as the second option for cameras, the M2 card + antennas listed as the first option for wifi, and the 65mm wheels listed as the second option for wheels were used. The total cost was approximately $300. The hardware setup time was approximately twelve hours spread between two days. A significant portion of the time was spent extracting a screw terminal from the motor board that was placed incorrectly. 1 shows the completed JetBot hardware assembly.
Motion Path Solver This notebook contains code for non-visual motion planning – the primary objective of the project. The code relies on an LMCP solver that takes an LMCP formulation in M, q, l, u, x 0 and returns a path of points of z, w, v, t. A pathsolver then iteratively solves LMCPs for Newton points along an overarching path, performing backward linesearch to progress sufficiently down each of these paths towards the predefined goal point.
Solving many LMCPs approximates a nonlinear path, which can be formulated as an NMCP for which the KKT conditions must first be derived. The KKT conditions are formulated symbolically so that KKT function as well as the Jacobian of the KKT can be passed to the pathsolver for sparse JIT evaluation, accelerating runtime. Once the point sequence is acquired, it is passed to a module for JetBot motion planning to attempt to move the JetBot along the equivalent trajectory on a real grid space.
Motion Algorithms To achieve the best motion possible on the JetBot, various motion planning algorithms were implemented: linear approximation, Manhattan (aka wiggle) motion, and proportional / integrative / derivative (PID) control. For some of these algorithms, the arctan2 function is used to compute the angle for turning from one orientation to another. (The full code for the JetBotMotion class is included in the appendix.)
arctan 2(∆y, ∆x)
The approximate relevant specifications measured for the JetBot were:
With two obstacles, sometimes the pathsolver fails if dt is too small =⇒ dt &gt; 0.1
Confirmed that the solved states [x, y, v x , v y ] closely approximate the dynamics of horizontal motion
JetBot moves forward 40cm in 0.75 sec at speed=1
JetBot rotates 360 degrees in 1 sec at speed=1

Abstract Image segmentation has been increasingly applied in medical settings as recent developments have skyrocketed the potential applications of deep learning. Urology, specifically, is one field of medicine that is primed for the adoption of a real-time image segmentation system with the long-term aim of automating endoscopic stone treatment. In this project, we explored supervised deep learning models to annotate kidney stones in surgical endoscopic video feeds. In this paper, we describe how we built a dataset from the raw videos and how we developed a pipeline to automate as much of the process as possible. For the segmentation task, we adapted and analyzed three baseline deep learning models – U-Net, U-Net++, and DenseNet – to predict annotations on the frames of the endoscopic videos with the highest accuracy above 90%. To show clinical potential for real-time use, we also confirmed that our best trained model can accurately annotate new videos at 30 frames per second. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method justifies continued development and study of image segmentation to annotate ureteroscopic video feeds.
Results Figure 1. A comparison of vanilla (V) and pretrained (P) model training accuracies. Vanilla U-Net and U-Net++ start at a lower accuracy of approximately 0.75 Dice and gradually converge to a Dice score of approximately 0.88. ImageNet- pretrained U-Net and U-Net++ start at approximately 0.85 Dice, the convergence of the vanilla versions, and converge to about 0.91 and 0.92 Dice, respectively. Figure 2. A comparison of our best models’ Dice score (left) and BCE loss (right) from training. Note that the y-axis is scaled to the range of values. DenseNet had the highest and most variant BCE loss, yet its outlier values are relatively low compared to those in other binary classification tasks as BCE does not have an upper bound. Figure 3. Sample frame from the side-by-side video reconstruction of the input, ground truth, automated prediction with U-Net++, and heat map (left to right). The heat map is the raw probability output per pixel whereas the predicted segmentation is the pixels with probabilities ≥ 0.5. The model was able to compute this output at 30 FPS. Table 1. Summary of the statistics gathered for each model. Non-parenthetical values are the average scores from all frames in the test set. The reported value in parentheses is the maximum value recorded from each baseline’s validation during training. The highest performances between models for each metric are denoted in bold. U-Net++ claimed the highest scores in each metric on the test set. U-Net had the same test Dice score as U-Net++ but lower scores in all other metrics. DenseNet had relatively poor performance for all metrics. Only the ROC curves from test set performances are included. Video 1. Example performance video of our best U-Net++ video on new data, not in train / val / test sets. The video shows a saline treatment and a stone that is being broken down with a laser. Detritus from the laser treatment is collecting to the left of the stone. This video is a typical example of what the model would see in a practical setting. Future To deploy our high-performing model for surgical use in operating rooms, we will extend our video processing script to receive “in-step” frame-by-frame video input from a video capture card connected via DVI/HDMI to the endoscopic hardware. Then, we will output the side-by-side frames, as in Figure 5, to an adjacent monitor to assist physicians in surgery. Developing such a system will allow us to investigate further goals, such as monocular depth prediction which might prove critical in automation.18
We will also investigate the application of temporal models for our system. Incorporating information from previous frames might allow for more consistent prediction between subsequent frames. In addition, such models account for memory of data from previous frames without the overhead of additional input dimensions suffered by our current fully convolutional models. For this task, we will incorporate self-attention modules into our U-Net and U-Net++ architectures, which has been shown to increase performance in video segmentation.19
In practice, the problem domain also requires the segmentation of kidney stones after they have been surgically broken down into smaller pieces. The current dataset has been developed to support the segmentation of only whole kidney stones. Further development will include expansion of another section of the dataset where, as a surgeon breaks stones apart, the debris fragments will still be labeled by our model. In Figure 5, our model already segments clumps of debris; however, our future goal is finer granularity via an instance segmentation method.20
Additionally, we plan to incorporate multi-class segmentation to also identify, for example, healthy vs. un- healthy tissue. Since the task performs well on stone segmentation, we hypothesize that we can utilize the same underlying architectures to adapt to multi-class segmentation and that the model will perform similarly well, with relatively few manually annotated examples.21

Abstract The striatum has traditionally been the focus of Huntington’s disease research due to the primary insult to this region and its central role in motor symptoms. Beyond the striatum, evidence of cortical alterations caused by Huntington’s disease has surfaced. However, findings are not coherent between studies which have used cortical thickness for Huntington’s disease since it is the well-established cortical metric of interest in other diseases. In this study, we propose a more comprehensive approach to cortical morphology in Huntington’s disease using cortical thickness, sulcal depth, and local gyrification index. Our results show consistency with prior findings in cortical thickness, including its limitations. Our comparison between cortical thickness and local gyrification index underscores the complementary nature of these two measures &ndash; cortical thickness detects changes in the sensorimotor and posterior areas while local gyrification index identifies insular differences. Since local gyrification index and cortical thickness measures detect changes in different regions, the two used in tandem could provide a clinically relevant measure of disease progression. Our findings suggest that differences in insular regions may correspond to earlier neurodegeneration and may provide a complementary cortical measure for detection of subtle early cortical changes due to Huntington’s disease.
Results CT Fig 1. Omnibus test results for CT showing the regions of significant contrast across all patients compared to controls. P-values were adjusted for FWER using random field theory (\alpha=0.01). SD Fig 2. Omnibus test results for SD showing the regions of significant contrast across all patients compared to controls. P-values were adjusted for FWER using random field theory (\alpha=0.01). LGI Fig 3. Omnibus test results for LGI showing the regions of significant contrast across all patients compared to controls. P-values were adjusted for FWER using random field theory (\alpha=0.01). Summary Table 1. Summary of Regions with Significant Changes Per Feature. The percentage of the structure with significant changes are reported, in terms of the number of vertices. Regions are color-coded according to cooccurrence in the three features. Red = regional changes were detected by all three features. Yellow = regional changes were detected by two of the features. Blue = regional changes were detected by one of the features. Takeaways A main takeaway was learning the scientific process in action and, most importantly, learning to work with more experienced researchers. I wrote the code and performed all of the analysis that produced our results. However, I did not develop the awesome acquisition method that generated our LGI data nor the statistical theory behind the analysis. Throughout the project, I have relied heavily on the expertise of my co-authors &ndash; all of whom have PhDs whereas I was an undergrad until recently. This first journey in research has been inspiring and indelible. I am beyond grateful for it!

Motivation After many face palms and harrowing all-nighters, I learned that achieving reliable performance, for even a task as simple-sounding as face following, is a true feat worthy of ascension from padawan to knight. Even though teams of engineers can concoct relatively high-performing models, I&rsquo;ve learned from first-hand experience, as many others have, that even at the highest level ML messes up&hellip; a lot.
For computer vision in particular, neural networks [NNs] tend to mess up when images are perturbed in some way, e.g., a brightness attack or a deformation, which may be imperceptible to the human eye. Read about optical adversarial attacks against road sign classifiers and defeating deepfake detectors. Subtle intensity differences between images frequently confounds analysis in image-based learning and applications; for example, I also research methods for harmonization of longitudinal MRI datasets using GANs to correct these minute differences. As I was learning about formal methods and automated verification, I wondered whether NNs can be verified for robustness against attacks and, in turn, also verify the performance of generator networks, such as autoencoders, in generating utile images. As a learning experience, this exploratory project is a classic case of &ldquo;know thy enemy&rdquo;.
Content train_segnet.m: trains a SegNet on MNIST train_VAE.m: trains a VAE on MNIST verify_segnet.m: attempts verification of SegNet given perturbed or unperturbed input verify_VAE.m: attempts verification of VAE given perturbed or unperturbed input Other files are ported or modified from MATLAB&rsquo;s VAE demo.
Method For a light background on some of the set theory behind neural network verification and why this task is particularly challenging, please refer to the report linked at the top of this page.
For the first part of the project, I trained a VAE and SegNet, both with the ELBO loss function, on MNIST. Figures 1 and 2 display real and fake images for each network; the VAE tended to blur the image whereas the SegNet learned the structures suspiciously well, potentially a result of overfitting.
Figure 1. Examples of real inputs (left) and fake outputs (right) for the VAE. The pairs demonstrate examples where the VAE performs well and where it does not, noticeably a ‘9’ that becomes an ‘8’ and a ‘4’ that becomes a ‘9’. Figure 2. Examples of real inputs (left) and fake outputs (right) for the SegNet autoencoder. Compared to the VAE, the SegNet is less confused about the structure of the input images. However, the two channel output results in an average of the binary masks which gives a gray image. After training the generator networks, I parsed them into NNV format and appended an MNIST classifier to each of them. In a tutorial, NNV constructed a simple CNN MNIST classifier that performed exceedingly well so I ported that model into this project.
To verify robustness of the generator + classifier, the top 1% or 5% of pixels in input images were eliminated, where the lower bound zeroed out the original intensity while the upper bound kept 5% of the original intensity. From here, NNV constructs polytope set representations of the input domain to feed to the NNV representations of the networks, in order to approximate the entirety of the output domain as a zonotope, star, and abstract polytope reach set.
In terms of analysis, NNV plots error bars, denoting the upper and lower bound probabilities that a given example belongs to each class, for each reach set. A network is robust for a certain class, for a certain set, if the lower bound for the class is greater than the upper bound for all other classes, given an approximated reach set.
Results The approximated zonotope reach set was inconclusive for both models at each level of attack whereas ImageStar and abstract polytope sets had almost identical results and differentiated model performance; therefore, these two reach sets were used in subsequent analyses. For the baseline, the output domains became too varied with greater levels of attack that were not reasonably computable on a CPU so no data was gathered for classes at those levels of attack for the baseline. Table 1 contains a summary of the results for each class for MNIST (baseline) and generated VAE &amp; SegNet images. Both models were particularly robust to the digit 3; the star set results are displayed for this class are displayed in Figure 3.
Table 1. Summary of results per class for baseline, VAE, and SegNet images passed to the classifier. - = robust; {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} = not robust, misclassified to digit; ? = not robust, uncertain, overlapping ranges; ~ = no data. Figure 3. Error bars for the digit ‘3’ for each method for the ImageStar set for the 1% attack. The classifier was distinctly robust to this class for the three types of images, for both attacks. Compared to other classes, the error bars for the ‘3’ class are very narrow for an attacked image. Future This field of NN verification is extremely new and methods for verifying networks with activations other than ReLU and sigmoid are not well-defined. I learned about the field of neural network verification from this project and at the time of writing I am satisfied by what I&rsquo;ve learned. Extending the project, formulating a procedure for verifying generator network outputs with automated NN verification would be a useful tool for many an ML practicioner. A procedure with the current SOTA using my generator + classifier setup might be feasible; however, I expect that we will have to wait for the field to progress significantly further.

Usage Clone the repo. cd viz/ python server.py Open the project notebook in Chrome. Safari will likely not work with the server. Tips:
If the view cells aren&rsquo;t rendered, run the server endpoint cells. It&rsquo;s a big, complex viz so it may take a while to compute the full graph to a point where you can interact with the views. Links Observable
GitHub
Motivation It seems like, in the past year, graph neural networks (GNN) have swept through every research circle and someone has spearheaded a journal club presentation about them. Anyways, my friend, Cole, was investigating a new GNN called a temporal graph network (TGN) for his masters thesis. To kill two birds with one stone, he proposed using a TGN for our course project in visual analytics &amp; ML and put into practice this esoteric method that we&rsquo;d only talked about so far.
For more background information, visit the Observable notebook linked above.
Method Preliminaries &amp; Back end: To generate the graph using ACCRE, we ran the TGN on the Wikipedia dataset from http://snap.stanford.edu/jodie/ on both the basic link prediction task for the probability data and the node classification task for the context data. To preprocess and arrange the graph, we used NetworkX. To serve the data, we used Flask and, to compute t-SNE, we used SciKit-Learn. All backend code was written in Python and can be cloned from https://github.com/zstoebs/tgn.
Front end: TGNVis currently has 3 main views: a full graph view, a subgraph view, and a subgraph scatterplot view. The full graph view consists of a link-node diagram that displays all of the nodes in the validation set. Each link color is scaled logarithmically based on the timestamp of the link occurring, with brighter and more saturated colors representing later timestamps. Link opacity linearly encodes the probability of the link occurring according to our model, with more opaque links signifying a higher predicted probability. Users can pan and zoom around the full graph view as well as brush when holding the Alt key (Windows / Linux) or Command key (macOS) to select a subset of nodes that will populate the subgraph view and the scatterplot. When nodes are brushed in the full graph, they will change colors from black to purple. Brushing in d3.js does not coexist well with most other interactions so it is inherently bugged; we suggest waiting for the force simulation to settle and trying to repeatedly to brush.
The subgraph view consists of nodes that have been brushed on the full graph view, plus all of their 1-hop connections. Once the subgraph is populated, hovering over a node or a link will provide the available information about the node or link being displayed. Once again, users can pan and zoom around the subgraph to inspect specific elements. Upon brushing again in the full graph, the subgraph and scatterplots will repopulate.
The scatterplot view contains the 2-component t-SNE dimensionality reduction view of the context embeddings available for the source and destination nodes of links on the subgraph. In order to retain the most information possible for each link, we provide two subplots that display reduced source and destination embeddings, left to right respectively. We also provide brushing functionality for our scatterplot view on the source node plot. When the plot is brushed, the brushed points will change color to blue, and the corresponding points in the destination scatterplot will also change color to red and lines are drawn to identify the links between selected nodes in the scatterplots. In addition, the subgraph view will update the colors of the selected nodes accordingly with one caveat: if it corresponds to both a source and destination embedding, it will change to purple. Nodes are often involved in multiple link events and therefore have multiple instances in
Views Full Graph Fig 1. The full-graph view displays the full link prediction graph output. It serves as the highest point for analysis. Users can zoom, pan, and brush over a subgraph for closer inspection. Subgraph Fig 2. The subgraph view displays the brushed selection from the full-graph view. Hovering over links and nodes populates their information. For nodes, hovering just displays the node's ID whereas hovering over the link populates source and target IDs, predicted probability, and the timestamp. Scatterplot Fig 3. The scatterplot view displays the 2-dim t-SNE reduction for all source and target nodes in the subgraph view. The view allows brushing over the source nodes to identify their corresponding target nodes and also highlight the selected source and target nodes accordingly in the subgraph. References F.

Motivation Following my quad build experience, I set the intention to continue working with and learning more about quads. Whereas in that project I focused more on the hardware side of quads, I wanted to focus more on the software side in this one. Specifically, I wanted to program a quad with autonomous functionality. While working on the quad build, I stumbled upon face detection &amp; following and SLAM. Face detection &amp; following is straightforward: use deep learning to draw a bounding box around faces in the image and compute the direction to travel based on the size and offset from the image&rsquo;s center. vSLAM on the other hand is more interesting in my opinion. For those that don&rsquo;t know: simultaneous localization &amp; mapping (SLAM) uses sensor data, i.e., lidar, radar, camera, etc., to create a map and track the location(s) of the agent(s) on the map. This problem is intractable and elegantly implementing it in the field is a unique challenge, often requiring a team with intimate knowledge of the UAV to tailor clever SLAM algorithms to it.
Contents main.m: control flow script to demonstrate each of these on the Tello. follow.m: face detection and following algorithm that returns the movement vector required to center the drone on the detected face, if there is one. vslam.m: implements vSLAM using the drone&rsquo;s pinhole camera given a predetermined movement sequence that should be cycled a handful of times. Method Face Following Algorithm:
Pass the frame to the object detector and retrieve a bounding box location(s) for the detected object. Draw boxes around all of the detected images. Use the closest bounding box’s width and center coordinates to compute the relative axis change as a percentage of the max. Based on some threshold percentage and some minimum movement distance, set the axes distances and return them to be used in a move command. Fig 1. Face following schematic. An image is passed to the cascade object detector. The detector draws a bounding box around the face. The centering vector from the current center to the center of the bounding box is computed. The UAV moves in the direction of the centering vector while maintaining a safe, specified distance. vSLAM This vSLAM implementation breaks down into three key parts: map initialization, tracking and local mapping.
Starting with map initialization, the steps are as follows:
Track the ORB features on the first image to load the pre-points, then track a second image. Match the ORB feature correspondences between the two images. If enough matches are made (100), compute the homography and fundamental matrices so that the correct geometric transform is applied based on which results in the least error for the relative camera pose. If insufficient matches are made, then the loop restarts on a new image. Manually, the loop has a maximum of 5 iterations to find a matched image until an error is thrown. If a match is not made in 5 iterations, it may imply that the Tello has weak connection and low light and needs to be reset. Triangulate the 3D locations of the matched features in the new map. For tracking:
Move the drone according to the modulus of the current move index by the length of the move sequence. If the Tello loses connection and throws an error, loop back to see if connection is regained, changing no indices except a break iteration countdown of 10. Throw the error if the break countdown expires. Extract ORB features from the frame and match with the latest keyframe. If the new frame is not a keyframe, continue the loop. Estimate the camera pose with Perspective-n-Point [10] in order to project the features to the current frames perspective and correct using some bundle adjustments[8]. This step, although esoteric, is important for the fast computation of that ORB-SLAM offers compared to the competition. Determine if the current frame is a key frame given the criteria. If so, the process continues to local mapping. Else, the loop iterates, and the above steps are redone for the next frame. Additionally, this step also speeds up the process; instead of evaluating all of the features in every frame for mapping, only a select few that are substantially different are filtered for usage. The local mapping steps are as follows:
Add the new keyframe to the set. Compare the keyframes features against all the other keyframe features, looking for unmatched points that occur in at least 3 other keyframes. Bundle adjust the pose based on the adjacent keyframes’ poses. Fig 2. Visual ORB-SLAM schematic. The process starts by initializing the map with two initial frames from the camera. During the initialization the UAV jiggles up and down to snapshot slightly different pairs of images with different feature extractions but still with some matches. If the map initializes, then the program proceeds to the main loop where it first tracks the features on a new frame. If the frame is a keyframe, then the new features are updated into the map. If the frame is not a keyframe, then the loop continues. At the start of each loop iteration, the UAV executes the next move in the sequence. Results Face Following Fig 3. Examples of when my face is detected. Looking at the Tello (left) and not looking at the Tello (right). Nonetheless, it still detects my face and doesn’t pick up much noise, even in low light. Fig 4. Example of face misclassification. These misclassifications typically occur when there is no face in view of the camera. Otherwise, they are rare and not noticeable during a face following run. Face following was easy to implement. The ony hindrance was the occasional misclassification confusing the Tello, causing it to align with that &ldquo;face&rdquo;. You can see from these face detection frames that a bounding box was computed. From here, the distance to the target can be inferred from the area of the bounding box and the alignment offset can be inferred from the bounding box center&rsquo;s distance from the frame&rsquo;s center.
vSLAM Fig 5. Example of a map initialization feature match. Typically, the map initialized and I could get a sense of where the features were. Fig 6. Examples of good (left) and average (right) feature extraction. Often times, the good initial feature extractions really set the momentum for how the rest of the main loop would turn out. Notice that the busier nearby area with more edges acquires more features. Fig 7. Examples of map plots and estimated trajectories and camera pose. Both of the movement sequences were left and right images and that the number on the camera indicates that there were 10 keyframes in this vSLAM run. vSLAM was a much harder task to get right. One crux of the system was the speed at which the Tello captured frames; for vSLAM to work well, frames need to be captured in quick succession, with very slight movements. Precisely moving the Tello proved to be very challenging with the MATLAB toolkit, plus an indoor environment where the Tello&rsquo;s own gusts reflecting off of hard surfaces would significantly alter its course. Regardless, the system was still able to generate a point cloud and update location within the map.
Future Streamline main.m with user input to guide the program and improve the functionality of vslam.m as best I can for Tello. Implement general object detection alongside the face detection pipeline. Add autonomous movement based on point cloud &ndash;&gt; remove need for a predetermined path. The implementations here are stepping stones to some more intelligent autonomous UAV behavior. I have the idea that I&rsquo;ll implemennt path planning on a Tello as well. Once I have that, I may integrate these three features into a Tello hide-n-seek project. References Papers P. Viola and M.

Motivation As I began learning about ML and statistical ML in particular, I became fascinated by dimensionality reduction (DR) methods. For those that don&rsquo;t know, DRs project data from a high-dimensional space to a low-dimensional space. In essence, they are generalizations of the vector projection methods onto the x-, y-, and z-axes taught in a multivariable calculus course. DR is akin to conventional information compression, trading off size for information loss so choosing the best method and lower dimension is as much art as it is strategy.
Content I used this project to put fingers to keyboard and learn through implementation. I explored two avenues, applying
PCA An autoencoder to a waveform-to-cell type classification problem.
PCA is the OG DR method. It decomposes the covariance matrix of the dataset to discover components that explain the most variance of the dataset. Then, the dataset is projected onto these components, which often times could .
Autoencoders (AEs) are a deep neural network (DNN) that learns to encode examples in a dataset to a lower dimensional latent vector and then decode the latent vector back to the original example. Usually, AEs learn to project examples to a manifold, i.e., they are non-linear DR methods.
Essentially, this project compares linear vs. non-linear DR.
Method Dataset The dataset and article Sofroniew, Nicholas James et al. “Neural coding in barrel cortex during whisker-guided locomotion.” can be found on the author&rsquo;s GitHub repo. Of the 16,000 recorded neurons, approx. 30 neurons were recorded for each of 13 subjects. Each recording was comprised of 53 voltage measurements. Overall, the dataset is composed of 302 waveforms. Unavoidably, the dataset is unbalanced; regular spikers comprise 247 of the examples while intermediate spikers only make up 4 examples.
Figure 1. Summary of the waveforms with mean waveform (left) and waveform distributions by cell type (right). Note that the mean waveform is essentially the tightly bounded waveform distribution for regular spikers, which dominate the dataset. Classification To compare and contrast the baseline, PCA, and autoencoding, I implemented a KNN classifier that uses Euclidean distance and majority vote for classification. To find the best number of neighbors given the dataset, I ran it through a standard hyperparameter search using cross-validation and a stratified split of the dataset to mitigate unbalanced classes. Once a good k-value was found, I evaluated the model on the test set, as well as a reclassification of the training set for debugging purposes.
Results The experiments for PCA and autoencoding had the same structure: 1. find the best reduced dimensionality, 2. reduce the dataset, and 3. test with KNN.
Figure 2. Scree plot (left) and cumulative explained variance of the first N components (right) from PCA applied to the waveforms. Table 1. Baseline results for a KNN fit on 53-dimensional waveform feature vectors. Table 2. PCA results for a KNN fit on 3- dimensional waveform components. Figure 3. 3D spatial distribution of the waveform principal components from PCA. Table 3. Autoencoding results for a KNN fit on 3-dimensional waveform components. Figure 4. 3D spatial distribution of the encodings from the bottleneck layer of the autoencoder. For both PCA and autoencoding, the accuracy is only slightly worse than that of the baseline. For PCA, the test accuracy is exactly the same for the 3 seeds while for the autoencoder it is only slightly worse. On the other hand, for the debug accuracy, PCA performs worse than the baseline while the autoencoder performs better. Given that trend, it might suggest that the autoencoder is somewhat overfitting the dataset, diminishing its generalizability. However, the test accuracy suggests that it is not significantly detrimental. All in all, dimensionality reduction still yields data suitable for high performance, even with information loss.
Future PCA is a fixed method but AEs are newer and more flexible. A whole study could be done just exploring AE architectures that yield the best projection for this classification task, not to mention other relevant tasks. Of course, other non-DNN non-linear DR methods could be applied to this dataset, which would be particularly interesting for the classification of waveform to subject. Perhaps one of those methods or an AE would be able to adequately separate these classes, which were not easily separable by PCA when I tried.
