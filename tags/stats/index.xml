Abstract Compressed sensing reconstructs signals by solving underdetermined linear systems under the con- ditions that the measurements are sparse in the domain and incoherent [1]. In engineering, if measurements are taken within an appropriate basis satisfying the restricted isometry property, i.e., the Gaussian, Bernoulli, or Fourier bases, then this prior structure makes full signal recovery possible [2].
Compressed sensing is challenging with fMRI because the temporal dynamics of hemodynamic signals are relatively slow compared to other fast-acquisition signals that historically benefit from compressed sensing [3]. Additionally, having fewer samples insinuates a loss of statistical power in subsequent analyses. Thankfully, fMRI signals boast two beneficial characteristics that are promising for compressed sensing: 1. they are linear time-invariant, and 2. they lie within, and can transformed by, a Fourier basis [4].
In medical imaging, it is often assumed that an image is sampled at the Nyquist rate, s.t., enough discrete measurements are taken to reconstruct a continuous whole (M &gt; N) without loss of information. If high-fidelity reconstruction is possible sampling below the Nyquist rate, then MRI modalities would benefit since discerning a signal and quickly turning over an analysis reduces real costs. These potential gains beg the question: if an underdetermined linear system can be solved after sampling below the Nyquist rate, can we collect fewer samples and still recover a high-quality fMRI under a compressed sensing paradigm? The purpose of this project is to explore approaches to compressed sensing that yield meaningful signal recoveries from heavy undersampling.

We found that, with a novel method for measuring gyrification, LGI uniquely detects changes in the insula. Of note, I learned that complicated statistical anlayses are uniquely challenging, that I love LMMs and RFT, and that they are too esoteric in the current day &ndash; let&rsquo;s make them more accessible!

Abstract The striatum has traditionally been the focus of Huntington’s disease research due to the primary insult to this region and its central role in motor symptoms. Beyond the striatum, evidence of cortical alterations caused by Huntington’s disease has surfaced. However, findings are not coherent between studies which have used cortical thickness for Huntington’s disease since it is the well-established cortical metric of interest in other diseases. In this study, we propose a more comprehensive approach to cortical morphology in Huntington’s disease using cortical thickness, sulcal depth, and local gyrification index. Our results show consistency with prior findings in cortical thickness, including its limitations. Our comparison between cortical thickness and local gyrification index underscores the complementary nature of these two measures &ndash; cortical thickness detects changes in the sensorimotor and posterior areas while local gyrification index identifies insular differences. Since local gyrification index and cortical thickness measures detect changes in different regions, the two used in tandem could provide a clinically relevant measure of disease progression. Our findings suggest that differences in insular regions may correspond to earlier neurodegeneration and may provide a complementary cortical measure for detection of subtle early cortical changes due to Huntington’s disease.
Results CT Fig 1. Omnibus test results for CT showing the regions of significant contrast across all patients compared to controls. P-values were adjusted for FWER using random field theory (\alpha=0.01). SD Fig 2. Omnibus test results for SD showing the regions of significant contrast across all patients compared to controls. P-values were adjusted for FWER using random field theory (\alpha=0.01). LGI Fig 3. Omnibus test results for LGI showing the regions of significant contrast across all patients compared to controls. P-values were adjusted for FWER using random field theory (\alpha=0.01). Summary Table 1. Summary of Regions with Significant Changes Per Feature. The percentage of the structure with significant changes are reported, in terms of the number of vertices. Regions are color-coded according to cooccurrence in the three features. Red = regional changes were detected by all three features. Yellow = regional changes were detected by two of the features. Blue = regional changes were detected by one of the features. Takeaways A main takeaway was learning the scientific process in action and, most importantly, learning to work with more experienced researchers. I wrote the code and performed all of the analysis that produced our results. However, I did not develop the awesome acquisition method that generated our LGI data nor the statistical theory behind the analysis. Throughout the project, I have relied heavily on the expertise of my co-authors &ndash; all of whom have PhDs whereas I was an undergrad until recently. This first journey in research has been inspiring and indelible. I am beyond grateful for it!

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[ A shallow autoencoder's projection of 53-dimensional vectors to 3 dimensions. tl;dr I fell in love with dimensionality reduction when I was learning statistical ML. Since I also study neuroscience, I wanted to practice the art at the intersection of my interests. I compared the 3D projections of a 53-dimensional neurophysiology dataset produced by PCA and a shallow autoencoder.

Motivation As I began learning about ML and statistical ML in particular, I became fascinated by dimensionality reduction (DR) methods. For those that don&rsquo;t know, DRs project data from a high-dimensional space to a low-dimensional space. In essence, they are generalizations of the vector projection methods onto the x-, y-, and z-axes taught in a multivariable calculus course. DR is akin to conventional information compression, trading off size for information loss so choosing the best method and lower dimension is as much art as it is strategy.
Content I used this project to put fingers to keyboard and learn through implementation. I explored two avenues, applying
PCA An autoencoder to a waveform-to-cell type classification problem.
PCA is the OG DR method. It decomposes the covariance matrix of the dataset to discover components that explain the most variance of the dataset. Then, the dataset is projected onto these components, which often times could .
Autoencoders (AEs) are a deep neural network (DNN) that learns to encode examples in a dataset to a lower dimensional latent vector and then decode the latent vector back to the original example. Usually, AEs learn to project examples to a manifold, i.e., they are non-linear DR methods.
Essentially, this project compares linear vs. non-linear DR.
Method Dataset The dataset and article Sofroniew, Nicholas James et al. “Neural coding in barrel cortex during whisker-guided locomotion.” can be found on the author&rsquo;s GitHub repo. Of the 16,000 recorded neurons, approx. 30 neurons were recorded for each of 13 subjects. Each recording was comprised of 53 voltage measurements. Overall, the dataset is composed of 302 waveforms. Unavoidably, the dataset is unbalanced; regular spikers comprise 247 of the examples while intermediate spikers only make up 4 examples.
Figure 1. Summary of the waveforms with mean waveform (left) and waveform distributions by cell type (right). Note that the mean waveform is essentially the tightly bounded waveform distribution for regular spikers, which dominate the dataset. Classification To compare and contrast the baseline, PCA, and autoencoding, I implemented a KNN classifier that uses Euclidean distance and majority vote for classification. To find the best number of neighbors given the dataset, I ran it through a standard hyperparameter search using cross-validation and a stratified split of the dataset to mitigate unbalanced classes. Once a good k-value was found, I evaluated the model on the test set, as well as a reclassification of the training set for debugging purposes.
Results The experiments for PCA and autoencoding had the same structure: 1. find the best reduced dimensionality, 2. reduce the dataset, and 3. test with KNN.
Figure 2. Scree plot (left) and cumulative explained variance of the first N components (right) from PCA applied to the waveforms. Table 1. Baseline results for a KNN fit on 53-dimensional waveform feature vectors. Table 2. PCA results for a KNN fit on 3- dimensional waveform components. Figure 3. 3D spatial distribution of the waveform principal components from PCA. Table 3. Autoencoding results for a KNN fit on 3-dimensional waveform components. Figure 4. 3D spatial distribution of the encodings from the bottleneck layer of the autoencoder. For both PCA and autoencoding, the accuracy is only slightly worse than that of the baseline. For PCA, the test accuracy is exactly the same for the 3 seeds while for the autoencoder it is only slightly worse. On the other hand, for the debug accuracy, PCA performs worse than the baseline while the autoencoder performs better. Given that trend, it might suggest that the autoencoder is somewhat overfitting the dataset, diminishing its generalizability. However, the test accuracy suggests that it is not significantly detrimental. All in all, dimensionality reduction still yields data suitable for high performance, even with information loss.
Future PCA is a fixed method but AEs are newer and more flexible. A whole study could be done just exploring AE architectures that yield the best projection for this classification task, not to mention other relevant tasks. Of course, other non-DNN non-linear DR methods could be applied to this dataset, which would be particularly interesting for the classification of waveform to subject. Perhaps one of those methods or an AE would be able to adequately separate these classes, which were not easily separable by PCA when I tried.
