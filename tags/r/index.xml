I wrote code in R and MATLAB to fit LMMs to the cortical data from T1w MRI of HD patients and then performed statistical analyses on the results using SurfStat and random field theory.

Background My first complete research project, a main takeaway was learning the scientific process in action and, most importantly, learning to work with more experienced researchers. I wrote the code and performed all of the analysis that produced our results. However, I did not develop the awesome acquisition method that generated our LGI data nor the statistical theory behind the analysis. Throughout the project, I have relied heavily on the expertise of my co-authors &amp;ndash; all of whom have PhDs whereas I was an undergrad until recently. This first journey in research has been inspiring and indelible and I am beyond grateful for it!

Abstract The striatum has traditionally been the focus of Huntington’s disease research due to the resulting primary insult and its central role in motor symptoms. Beyond the striatum, evidence of cortical alterations caused by Huntington’s disease has surfaced; however, findings are not coherent between studies. A number of studies have used cortical thickness as the cortical metric of interest due to its establishment in the role of Huntington’s disease. In this study, we propose a more comprehensive approach to cortical morphology using cortical thickness (CT), sulcal depth (SD), and local gyrification index (LGI). Our results show consistency with prior findings in cortical thickness, including its limitations. Comparing between cortical thickness and local gyrification index underscores the complementary nature of these two measures; cortical thickness detects changes in the sensorimotor and posterior areas while local gyrification index identifies insular differences. Since the local gyrification index and cortical thickness measures detect changes in different regions, the two used in tandem could provide a clinically relevant measure of disease progression. Our findings suggest that differences in insular regions correspond to earlier neurodegeneration and may provide a complementary cortical measure for detection of subtle cortical changes due to Huntington’s disease.
Results These results are only the top-most. for all of the tables, charts, etc., please check out the paper once it is published.
CT  Fig 1. Omnibus test results for CT showing the regions of significant contrast across all patients compared to controls. P-values were adjusted for FWER using random field theory (\alpha=0.01).   SD  Fig 2. Omnibus test results for SD showing the regions of significant contrast across all patients compared to controls. P-values were adjusted for FWER using random field theory (\alpha=0.01).   LGI  Fig 3. Omnibus test results for LGI showing the regions of significant contrast across all patients compared to controls. P-values were adjusted for FWER using random field theory (\alpha=0.01).   Summary   Table 1. Summary of Regions with Significant Changes Per Feature. The percentage of the structure with significant changes are reported, in terms of the number of vertices. Regions are color-coded according to cooccurrence in the three features. Red = regional changes were detected by all three features. Yellow = regional changes were detected by two of the features. Blue = regional changes were detected by one of the features.
