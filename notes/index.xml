      <content:encoded><![CDATA[tl;dr I bet you have no idea what this is. You&amp;rsquo;ve definitely seen one before&amp;hellip; but you just didn&amp;rsquo;t know it. Boo!
To help you understand, if these tail a structure in a sentence then it: ;) --- is, or could be formed as, a hendiadys. :&#39;( -- could be confused as a possible hendiadys.  However, if you were aware of the hendiadys, then go you! I&amp;rsquo;m impressed. I&amp;rsquo;ll admit that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of this technique until a a couple of years ago when I was reading On Grand Strategy by John Lewis Gaddis. Gaddis covers humanity&amp;rsquo;s great leaders ;) &amp;ndash; from anitquity to modernity, in chronological order, where each chapter is devoted to one leader and their strategies ;). In the chapter on Queen Elizabeth, in many of her political letters, particularly those to King Philip of Spain, her hendiadys empowered her &amp;ndash; a virgin queen who may both save her country and leave a legacy &amp;ndash; and &amp;ldquo;positioned a culture against paralysis in world that was to come.&amp;rdquo; As noted in this chapter, other masters of hendiadys include Cranmer and Shakespeare.
&amp;ldquo;Hendiadys&amp;rdquo; translates literally as &amp;ldquo;one through two&amp;rdquo; which is easy to explain but conceals the subliminal gestalt &amp;ndash; greater than the sum of its parts. In simpler words, it is the expression of two words, such as but not limited to an adjective and its noun, :&#39;( separated by a conjunction; instead of the former only modifying the latter, they stand alone but also together, augmenting each other. One of the most classic examples is &amp;ldquo;nice and warm&amp;rdquo; ;) in lieu of &amp;ldquo;nicely warm.&amp;rdquo; The two words are separate but each contributes to the other&amp;rsquo;s meaning in context, with a cup of morning coffee for example. For me at least, the latter phrasing is far less effective than the hendiadys. If you say the two versions aloud, you may notice as well that it&amp;rsquo;s much easier to add more dramatic inflection to the hendiadys.
In poetry, these devices are incredibly powerful, adding emphasis and rhythm :&#39;( [but maybe ;) in the right context??]. However, they trade conciseness for that effect. To a lot of people, including myself, sacrificing conciseness is risky business, especially in poetry that is necessarily brief. Many haikuists would likely advise against such a structure. Nonetheless, when it works, hendiadys&#39; effect is devastating and beautiful ;) at least in my opinion and I use it in haiku when I feel like it.
In popular literature, rife usage of hendiadys occurs in Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s Hamlet. Paging through it, I spotted one used by Horatio early in Act I, maybe you can find an even earlier one, or a better one. If you&amp;rsquo;ve heard of hendiadys before, then you probably heard about it when you read this play in your high school English class. Lucky you; I wish hendiadys were discussed when my class read Hamlet some odd 5 years ago.
A related device is the hendiatris, which, you guessed it, unites three words, not necessarily with a conjunction. Hendiatris are much more popular and renowned than hendiadys because they work better as catchy slogans. For example:
 &amp;ldquo;Reduce, reuse, recycle&amp;rdquo;  It all builds up to recycle because, by recycling, you typically are reducing and reusing&amp;hellip; unless you&amp;rsquo;re drinking a ton of LaCroix.
 &amp;ldquo;Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&amp;rdquo;  For you to explain to yourself; don&amp;rsquo;t @ me with an unproductive philosophical debate.
 &amp;ldquo;Passion, courage of conviction, and a strong sense of self,&amp;rdquo; Elle Woods, Legally Blonde  What does this even mean? The movie is iconic and in my opinion you cannot have one of these ideas without the others.
 &amp;ldquo;Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!&amp;rdquo; Percy Bysshe Shelley, Ozymandias  If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read this brief poem, do that right the hell now. When you read this line, &amp;ldquo;my Works&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;ye Mighty&amp;rdquo; likely mean the same thing with an epic effect, then to round it off you read &amp;ldquo;despair.&amp;rdquo; At first glance, &amp;ldquo;despair&amp;rdquo; is a verb &amp;ndash; a command to the reader to know their place. However, how do you know? &amp;ldquo;Despair&amp;rdquo; could also be a noun to imply that Ozymandias&#39; mighty works are despair embodied.
 Ozymandias is one of my all-time favorites and that line in particular is possibly my favorite line in poetry, despite its not being a hendiadys.  In my opinion, crafting a good hendiadys is just as tricky, and just as impressive, as crafting a good hendiatris because saying so much more with less speaks to me more. This laconic gravity in hendiadys is what draws me to haiku &amp;amp; senryu in the first place because they give the reader room to interpret all of the opened space.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[For most of my life, I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing poetry when I experience a lightbulb moment. Over time, this habit shapeshifted to mainly haiku &amp;amp; senryu, often composing sequences of 23 - 31 or more on a day out. Although they&amp;rsquo;re usually reluctant to share, the more people that I&amp;rsquo;ve met, the more I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered also have this practice. People are like onions; they have layers. If you peel back enough, you&amp;rsquo;ll reach the heart &amp;ndash; haiku &amp;amp; senryu are the key to mine.
5 Tips  Haiku &amp;amp; senryu do not have to follow the 5-7-5 syllable pattern  In Japanese, the pattern is 5-7-5 onji but onji cannot be directly translated to “syllable” and even less so to English syllables, which are much longer. Nonetheless, many poets pay homage to 5-7-5. For example:
 The hackneyed 5-7-5 pattern Entire poems in 5 or 7 syllables Asymmetric subsections of 5 or 7 syllables (e.g. first two lines are 7 syllables total and last line is 5 syllables)  The closest structure in English poerty to onji is called the mora, aka a sound unit. 5-7-5 morae approximately correspond to 2-3-2 beats. I composed a haiku below and underlined each beat to demonstrate the rhythm:
  hunter&#39;s hound scans the fragrant wood -- flyting dove   I drift to the 2-3-2 beats method because it&amp;rsquo;s concise and maintains a prime structure &amp;ndash; 7 beats. Rule of thumb: a reader should be able to recite the poem in a single breath. Nonetheless, I sometimes don&amp;rsquo;t follow any structure at all; ultimately, it&amp;rsquo;s what sounds and feels right.
Haiku &amp;amp; senryu do not have to be written in 3 lines  Poems are visual and often times I&amp;rsquo;ll read poets that write their haiku as a single line, or space words on different lines to evoke structure. Here&amp;rsquo;s a senryu that I composed in three forms:
  grey drags :: precipice of too much vs. too little grey drags :: precipice of too much vs. too little grey drags :: precipice of too much vs. too little  
In my opinion, the weakest structure for this senryu is the traditional 3-line one.
Haiku &amp;amp; senryu should be built upon sensory images  Haiku are intrinsically tied with nature and senryu reflect on the human condition. Both types should generate an image in the reader&amp;rsquo;s mind, often tied with emotion. The goal is to literally capture an experience that evoked an emotion so that the reader may also experience that same emotion.
A complete haiku incorporates kigo, aka &amp;ldquo;seasonal reference&amp;rdquo;. The season can be associated with the haiku either through an explicit word or inferred from the image or culture of the poem.
Check this out: Here are some of Onishi Yasuyo&amp;rsquo;s astounding senryu. This selection is considered gendai haiku, aka modern haiku that challenge tradition.
Kireji, aka the &amp;ldquo;cutting word&amp;rdquo;, blur the boundary between haiku &amp;amp; senryu  Haiku &amp;amp; senryu often have kireji in the first or second line, which pivot the poem in a related, but new, direction. In English, poets sometimes denote them with punctuation. Kireji make two from one by splitting the poem into two ideas, either through the first two lines, the last two lines, or even both! If you look closely, the middle line of the poem separately relates to each of the first and last line but also connects them when they might otherwise stand apart.
As I&amp;rsquo;ve experimented with them, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that haiku &amp;amp; senryu are not necessarily mutually exclusive. What counts as haiku to one person may in face sound more like senryu to another, depending on the image it stirs in each. The way I see it: they are the two poles of a spectrum. Take the poem below for example:
  noon’s sidelight -- fall of the weighty screw wasted again   Is the screw wasted because, while I was building, it fell somewhere unreachable, or am I wasted at noon?? Up to you, chat.
History  Matsuo Basho is considered the first haiku master The term &amp;ldquo;haiku&amp;rdquo; was coined in the 19th century by poet Masaoka Shiki Haiku was originally the opening 3 lines of renga  Renga is a party poem where you go around a circle and each person crafts a stanza that logically follows from the previous stanza The opening stanza is a haiku, called a hokku in this context The closing stanza is two lines of 7 onji, called a geku   Tanka = hokku &#43; geku  Tanka was the form often used in samurai death poems and consists of 5 lines totaling 31 syllables, usually reflecting on the beauty of life and the environment    References  Higginson, William J., and Penny Harter.

      <title>on fast inverse square root</title>

      <description>I found it on YouTube and, as my friend Nolan reminded me the other night, this algorithm is not new. The fast inverse square root shook the nerd world with its implementation in Quake III (1999).</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[float Q_rsqrt( float number ) { long i; float x2, y; const float threehalfs = 1.5F; x2 = number * 0.5F; y = number; i = * ( long * ) &amp;amp;y; // part 1 i = 0x5f3759df - ( i &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1 ); // part 2 y = * ( float * ) &amp;amp;i; y = y * ( threehalfs - ( x2 * y * y ) ); // part 3 } I found it on YouTube and, as my friend Nolan reminded me the other night, this algorithm is not new. The fast inverse square root shook the nerd world with its implementation in Quake III (1999).
Notice that it doesn’t use any division operator which is naturally slow on a digital computer; this algorithm speeds up computation of the inverse square root by 3x compared to conventional division and square root operations. The reason for writing it in C is evident in the first part, although these tricks also have analogs in often in other languages such as C&#43;&#43;, Python, etc. and is thus implemented in those languages as well.
Part 1 It uses tricks inherent in the language to cast the address of float (aka a float pointer) to a long pointer. The importance of using a long is evinced in the second part because it allows for quick division by 2. Since standard binary numbers, unlike floats, are not disjointed numbers in base 2, a single right bit shift performs floor halving.
Part 2 This part is the real meat of the trickery in this clever solution. The second half I already explained in the first part but the first half involves rearranging the floating-point formula for a square root division to solve for scalar values. Recall that floating point numbers are comprised of a mantissa and an exponent. The actual digit number can then be composed of a formula of these two parts: (1 &#43; M/2^23)*2^(E - 127) . The exponent is shifted down by 127 in IEEE 754 in order to represent negative values so 2^4 is actually 2^(131-127) where 131 is the number passed in the exponent. Since the mantissa needs to be between 1 and 2 in binary a 1 is fixed as the first digit before the point and the mantissa is divided by 2^23 since the mantissa is represented by 23 bits. Taking the logarithm of the above formula results in: log(1&#43;M/2^23) &#43; log(2^(E - 127)) . The trick to the problem is that log(1&#43;x) ~= x &#43; mu for small numbers (e.g. fractions less than 1). So this simplifies to: M/2^23 &#43; mu &#43; E - 127. Rearranging results in: 1/2^23 * (M &#43; 2^23*E) &#43; mu - 127 which is much more useful because the bit representation of a floating point number (M &#43; 2^23*E) is included. Recall that the binary number for a floating number is 8 bits for E followed by 23 bits for M.
Now that the background is setup, we can continue calculating 1/sqrt(x), or actually 1/sqrt(y) in this case. With the rearrangements above, it becomes much easier to calculate the logarithm of a floating point number. So log(1/sqrt(y)) = log(y^(-1/2)) = -(1/2)*log(y) . So if we want to solve for some G s.t. G = 1/sqrt(y) where log(G) = -(1/2)log(y), we can substitute in the above rearranged logarithm formula for a floating point number and solve for the bit representation for G which ends up as: M_G &#43; 2^23*E_G = (3/2)*2^23*(127 - mu) - (1/2)*(M_y &#43; 2^23*E_y). Hence, the first term is that bizarre hexadecimal number and the dexter term is the subtracted single rightshift to halve the number.
The reason for casting the floating point y to a long should be fairly obvious; we need the hard-coded bit representation of y to be treated as such, not as a floating point number which has different arithmetic operators.
Part 3 The third step is a little esoteric but not as technical as the second step. As with everything on computers, the numbers computed prior to this step are just an approximation. Due to all of the assumptions previously made (e.g. that the halving above isn’t floored for an odd number, that our chosen mu is accurate, etc.), we need to correct by some amount. Cue the Newton Iteration, which computes the error of x from a root for the function y. For this problem, the function is f(y) = 1/y^2 - x which rearranges to y = 1/sqrt(x) when y is a root (e.g. f(y) = 0). We need to compute x_new = x - f(x)/f’(x). Breaking down the derivative of a function: the derivative is described by the tangent line and where it intercepts the x-axis, composing the triangle below:
 A useful reference for a function derivative.  Since the ratio of the shifts times the shift in x equals the shift in y, the shift in x can be solved for as the shift in y divided by the ratio which ends up as: f(x)/f’(x). The actual implementation details of this aren’t made clear by the video, nor is the function derivative computed and I’m quite uncertain about which variable we take the derivative from, x or y. Nonetheless, it results in a static expression without any division operators required.
