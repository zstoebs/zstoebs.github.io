      <description> Hi, I&#39;m Zach!  I love leveraging machine learning to solve challenging problems in neuroscience, in computer vision, and with hardware. I&amp;rsquo;m currently a graduate student researcher in VISE MedICL at Vanderbilt University investigating applied ML to medical and neuroscientific data &amp;ndash; mainly brain MRI for neurological diseases and endoscopic video feeds for nephrolithotomy. Generally, my interests are generative learning &amp;amp; dimensionality reduction, cyberphysical systems &amp;amp; robotics, and optimization &amp;amp; control theory.
Check out my projects to see what I&amp;rsquo;m working on!

 I graduated from Vandy in May 2021 with a B.S. in computer science and neuroscience, minoring in applied math. I expect to complete my masters in computer science from Vandy in May 2022.
During undergrad, I was a mentor in the VUSE Design Studio. I have had the privilege to assist with courses on discrete structures, operating systems, and deep learning.
 Outside of research, I enjoy heavy weights, friendship, haiku &amp;amp; senryu, hendiadys, esports, kombucha, cucumber cocktails, and sunset runs. Occasionally, I take a good photo and write a haiku or senryu to pair with it.
I am a Lusophone &amp;gt; Hispanophone &amp;gt; Francophone. I self-studied Portuguese throughout high school, then I took a crucial gap year of emotional and linguistic growth in Lisbon, Portugal.
My hometown is Austin, TX.
 I am always open to new opportunities, especially those that align with my interests. You can contact me at zachary.a.stoebner@vanderbilt.edu.
