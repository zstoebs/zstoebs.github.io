      <content:encoded><![CDATA[tl;dr My guide to effective brand management &amp;ndash; the tenets, epiphanies, and fruits of my efforts &amp;ndash; a reflection of tasteful pride and confidence &amp;ndash; a learning policy optimized over 24 years.
Morning Routine I&amp;rsquo;m not much of a morning person so I have to warm my brain up with a few bitesized games. Otherwise, it&amp;rsquo;s a slow process getting out of bed and motivating myself for the day. My ride-or-dies:
Chess.com Daily Puzzle NYT Daily Hard Sudoku Tenets I&amp;rsquo;m consistently optimizing, little by little. Serendipitously, I started thinking about some of these ideas as a kid. Although steadfast adherence helps me endure sometimes, I am updating and reevaluating because things change and people can do hard things&amp;hellip; such as admitting that I am wrong or that a tenet that I lived my life by up until now may not be optimal anymore.
Core Under no circumstances will I suffer religious zealotry, homophobia, or bigotry. Empathy, kindness, forgiveness, flexibility, and adaptability are more logical and worthwhile than apathy, hate, vindictiveness, rigidity, and immutability. I am an experience- and purpose-oriented person, less of a results- and -appearance oriented person, yet I am cognizant that the latter is advantageous in some contexts. I have to love what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, even the small things. Science, engineering, and math are the most fulfilling and constant themes of my life. My family by birth is important to me, as is my chosen family. My physical fitness, diet, and mental health are intertwined and are core to who I am. In frustrating situations, stepping back mentally, and sometimes physically, helps me see the macro-perspective, to remind me of my reasons and to explore my best path forward. To build systems, I solve problems modularly and abstractly. For me, it all comes together with significantly less frustration if I have implemented a set of tools to instrument my objectives&amp;hellip; and makes the code more appealing. I am amused by bespoke code. ifykyk. Observations My lifestyle is healthy, yet improvable&amp;hellip; and non-negotiable. A workout &#43; music / podcast / audiobook is my critical grounding mechanism, centering meditation, and emotional balancer. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to work out every day. I like to eat chocolate and all macarons. The two genius food combos of our day: chocolate &#43; peanut butter and sea salt &#43; chocolate chips. Cutting and bulking cycles are not conducive to my mental well-being. I like to exercise consistently, maintain my diet, and feel physically healthy all year. Almond milk and plant protein feel better to my body than cow&amp;rsquo;s milk and whey protein. Some video games provide real value to my life as an adult and many were critical to my growth as a youth. I watch battle royales on Twitch like straight men watch sports. The lessons and enjoyment gained from the rare role-playing game with a phenomenal story are valuable to me. Brand. Marketing. Is key. I love F1. Go Mercedes, go Hamilton! ]]></content:encoded>

      <description> Hi, I&#39;m Zach! I&amp;rsquo;m an Electrical &amp;amp; Computer Engineering PhD student at UT Austin on a Cockrell Engineering Fellowship working with Prof. Jon Tamir in the Computational Sensing and Imaging Lab.
My research spans deep learning, sensing &amp;amp; imaging, and computer vision. Generally, I&amp;rsquo;m curious about AI/ML &amp;amp; neuroscience, optimization &amp;amp; control, and intelligent systems &amp;amp; robotics.
Check out my projects to see what I&amp;rsquo;m working on, notes to see what I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about, and kū to see what I&amp;rsquo;m seeing!

I graduated from Vanderbilt University in 2021 with a B.S. in computer science and neuroscience, minoring in applied math, and then again in 2022 with my M.S. in computer science. I was a student researcher in VISE MedICL advised by Prof. Ipek Oguz and my thesis was on a deep learning-enabled automatic segmentation system for surgical endoscopy.
I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about connecting with the broader community on topics of science and engineering. During undergrad, I was a mentor in the VUSE Design Studio. I was also a reviewer, section leader, and graduate mentor for the Vanderbilt Undergraduate Research Journal.
I have had the privilege to assist with courses on discrete structures, operating systems, deep learning, AI, and ML projects.
I enjoy heavy weights, friendship, kū &amp;amp; photography, hendiadys, esports, kombucha, cucumber cocktails, and sunset runs.
I am an Anglophone &amp;gt; Lusophone &amp;gt; Hispanophone &amp;gt; Francophone. I self-studied Portuguese throughout high school, then I took a crucial gap year of emotional and linguistic growth in Lisbon, Portugal before undergrad.
My hometown is Austin, TX.
I&amp;rsquo;m always open to new opportunities, especially those that align with my interests. You can contact me at &#43;1(512)547-7486 or zstoebner@my.utexas.edu.
