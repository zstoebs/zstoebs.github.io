      <content:encoded><![CDATA[tl;dr Implementation of face detection / following and vSLAM on a Ryze Tello using its MATLAB toolkit.
Motivation Following my quad build experience, I set the intention of continuing to work with and learn more about quads. Whereas in that project I focused more on the hardware side of quads, I wanted to focus more on the software side in this one. Specifically, I wanted to program a quad with autonomous functionality. While working on the quad build, I stumbled upon face detection &amp;amp; following and SLAM. Face detection &amp;amp; following is straightforward: use deep learning to draw a bounding box around faces in the image and compute the direction to travel based on the size and offset from the image&amp;rsquo;s center. vSLAM on the other hand is more interesting in my opinion. For those that don&amp;rsquo;t know: simultaneous localization &amp;amp; mapping (SLAM) uses sensor data, i.e., lidar, radar, camera, etc., to create a map and track the location(s) of the agent(s) on the map. This problem is intractable and elegantly implementing it in the field is a unique challenge, often requiring a team with intimate knowledge of the UAV to tailor clever SLAM algorithms to it.
Contents  main.m: control flow script to demonstrate each of these on the Tello. follow.m: face detection and following algorithm that returns the movement vector required to center the drone on the detected face, if there is one. vslam.m: implements vSLAM using the drone&amp;rsquo;s pinhole camera given a predetermined movement sequence that should be cycled a handful of times.  Method Face Following Algorithm:
 Pass the frame to the object detector and retrieve a bounding box location(s) for the detected object. Draw boxes around all of the detected images. Use the closest bounding box’s width and center coordinates to compute the relative axis change as a percentage of the max. Based on some threshold percentage and some minimum movement distance, set the axes distances and return them to be used in a move command.    Fig 1. Face following schematic. An image is passed to the cascade object detector. The detector draws a bounding box around the face. The centering vector from the current center to the center of the bounding box is computed. The UAV moves in the direction of the centering vector while maintaining a safe, specified distance.  vSLAM This vSLAM implementation breaks down into three key parts: map initialization, tracking and local mapping.
Starting with map initialization, the steps are as follows:
 Track the ORB features on the first image to load the pre-points, then track a second image. Match the ORB feature correspondences between the two images. If enough matches are made (100), compute the homography and fundamental matrices so that the correct geometric transform is applied based on which results in the least error for the relative camera pose. If insufficient matches are made, then the loop restarts on a new image. Manually, the loop has a maximum of 5 iterations to find a matched image until an error is thrown. If a match is not made in 5 iterations, it may imply that the Tello has weak connection and low light and needs to be reset. Triangulate the 3D locations of the matched features in the new map.  For tracking:
 Move the drone according to the modulus of the current move index by the length of the move sequence. If the Tello loses connection and throws an error, loop back to see if connection is regained, changing no indices except a break iteration countdown of 10. Throw the error if the break countdown expires. Extract ORB features from the frame and match with the latest keyframe. If the new frame is not a keyframe, continue the loop. Estimate the camera pose with Perspective-n-Point [10] in order to project the features to the current frames perspective and correct using some bundle adjustments[8]. This step, although esoteric, is important for the fast computation of that ORB-SLAM offers compared to the competition. Determine if the current frame is a key frame given the criteria. If so, the process continues to local mapping. Else, the loop iterates, and the above steps are redone for the next frame. Additionally, this step also speeds up the process; instead of evaluating all of the features in every frame for mapping, only a select few that are substantially different are filtered for usage.  The local mapping steps are as follows:
 Add the new keyframe to the set. Compare the keyframes features against all the other keyframe features, looking for unmatched points that occur in at least 3 other keyframes. Bundle adjust the pose based on the adjacent keyframes’ poses.   Fig 2. Visual ORB-SLAM schematic. The process starts by initializing the map with two initial frames from the camera. During the initialization the UAV jiggles up and down to snapshot slightly different pairs of images with different feature extractions but still with some matches. If the map initializes, then the program proceeds to the main loop where it first tracks the features on a new frame. If the frame is a keyframe, then the new features are updated into the map. If the frame is not a keyframe, then the loop continues. At the start of each loop iteration, the UAV executes the next move in the sequence.  Results Face Following   Fig 3. Examples of when my face is detected. Looking at the Tello (left) and not looking at the Tello (right). Nonetheless, it still detects my face and doesn’t pick up much noise, even in low light.     Fig 4. Example of face misclassification. These misclassifications typically occur when there is no face in view of the camera. Otherwise, they are rare and not noticeable during a face following run.   Face following was easy to implement. The ony hindrance was the occasional misclassification confusing the Tello, causing it to align with that &amp;ldquo;face&amp;rdquo;. You can see from these face detection frames that a bounding box computed. From here, the distance to the target can be inferred from the area of the bounding box and the alignment offset can be inferred from the bounding box center&amp;rsquo;s distance from the frame&amp;rsquo;s center.
vSLAM   Fig 5. Example of a map initialization feature match. Typically, the map initialized and I could get a sense of where the features were.     Fig 6. Examples of good (left) and average (right) feature extraction. Often times, the good initial feature extractions really set the momentum for how the rest of the main loop would turn out. Notice that the busier nearby area with more edges acquires more features.     Fig 7. Examples of map plots and estimated trajectories and camera pose. Both of the movement sequences were left and right images and that the number on the camera indicates that there were 10 keyframes in this vSLAM run.  vSLAM was a much harder task to get right. One crux of the system was the speed at which the Tello captured frames; for vSLAM to work well, frames need to be captured in quick succession, with very slight movements. Precisely moving the Tello proved to be very challenging with the MATLAB toolkit, plus an indoor environment where the Tello&amp;rsquo;s own gusts from its propellers reflected off of hard surfaces would significantly alter its course. Regardless, the system was still able to generate a point cloud and update location within the map.
Future  Streamline main.m with user input to guide the program and improve the functionality of vslam.m as best I can for Tello. Implement general object detection alongside the face detection pipeline. Add autonomous movement based on point cloud &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; remove need for a predetermined path. The implementations here are stepping stones to some more intelligent autonomous UAV behavior. I have the idea that I&amp;rsquo;ll implemennt path planning on a Tello as well. Once I have that, I may integrate these three features into a Tello hide-n-seek project.  Links GitHub

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[ A shallow autoencoder&#39;s projection of 53-dimensional vectors to 3 dimensions.  tl;dr I fell in love with dimensionality reduction when I was learning statistical ML. Since I also study neuroscience, I wanted to practice the art at the intersection of my interests. I compared the 3D projections of a 53-dimensional neurophysiology dataset produced by PCA and a shallow autoencoder.
Motivation As I began learning about ML and statistical ML in particular, I became fascinated by dimensionality reduction  (DR) methods. For those that don&amp;rsquo;t know, DRs project data from a high-dimensional space to a low-dimensional space. In essence, they are generalizations of the vector projection methods onto the x-, y-, and z-axes taught in a multivariable calculus course. DR is akin to conventional information compression, trading off size for information loss so choosing the best method and lower dimension is as much art as it is strategy.
Content I used this project to put fingers to keyboard and learn through implementation. I explored two avenues, applying
 PCA An autoencoder  to a waveform-to-cell type classification problem.
PCA is the OG DR method. It decomposes the covariance matrix of the dataset to discover components that explain the most variance of the dataset. Then, the dataset is projected onto these components, which often times could .
Autoencoders (AEs) are a deep neural network (DNN) that learns to encode examples in a dataset to a lower dimensional latent vector and then decode the latent vector back to the original example. Usually, AEs learn to project examples to a manifold, i.e., they are non-linear DR methods.
Essentially, this project compares linear vs. non-linear DR.
Method Dataset The dataset and article Sofroniew, Nicholas James et al. “Neural coding in barrel cortex during whisker-guided locomotion.” can be found on the author&amp;rsquo;s GitHub repo. Of the 16,000 recorded neurons, approx. 30 neurons were recorded for each of 13 subjects. Each recording was comprised of 53 voltage measurements. Overall, the dataset is composed of 302 waveforms. Unavoidably, the dataset is unbalanced; regular spikers comprise 247 of the examples while intermediate spikers only make up 4 examples.
 Figure 1. Summary of the waveforms with mean waveform (left) and waveform distributions by cell type (right). Note that the mean waveform is essentially the tightly bounded waveform distribution for regular spikers, which dominate the dataset.  Classification To compare and contrast the baseline, PCA, and autoencoding, I implemented a KNN classifier that uses Euclidean distance and majority vote for classification. To find the best number of neighbors given the dataset, I ran it through a standard hyperparameter search using cross-validation and a stratified split of the dataset to mitigate unbalanced classes. Once a good k-value was found, I evaluated the model on the test set, as well as a reclassification of the training set for debugging purposes.
Results The experiments for PCA and autoencoding had the same structure: 1. find the best reduced dimensionality, 2. reduce the dataset, and 3. test with KNN.
 Figure 2. Scree plot (left) and cumulative explained variance of the first N components (right) from PCA applied to the waveforms.   Table 1. Baseline results for a KNN fit on 53-dimensional waveform feature vectors.   Table 2. PCA results for a KNN fit on 3- dimensional waveform components.   Figure 3. 3D spatial distribution of the waveform principal components from PCA.   Table 3. Autoencoding results for a KNN fit on 3-dimensional waveform components.   Figure 4. 3D spatial distribution of the encodings from the bottleneck layer of the autoencoder.  For both PCA and autoencoding, the accuracy is only slightly worse than that of the baseline. For PCA, the test accuracy is exactly the same for the 3 seeds while for the autoencoder it is only slightly worse. On the other hand, for the debug accuracy, PCA performs worse than the baseline while the autoencoder performs better. Given that trend, it might suggest that the autoencoder is somewhat overfitting the dataset, diminishing its generalizability. However, the test accuracy suggests that it is not significantly detrimental. All in all, dimensionality reduction still yields data suitable for high performance, even with information loss.
Future PCA is a fixed method but AEs are newer and more flexible. A whole study could be done just exploring AE architectures that yield the best projection for this classification task, not to mention other relevant tasks. Of course, other non-DNN non-linear DR methods could be applied to this dataset, which would be particularly interesting for the classification of waveform to subject. Perhaps one of those methods or an AE would be able to adequately separate these classes, which were not easily separable by PCA when I tried.
