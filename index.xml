      <description> Hi, I&#39;m Zach!  I&amp;rsquo;m an Electrical &amp;amp; Computer Engineering PhD student at UT Austin on a Cockrell Engineering Fellowship working with Prof. Jon Tamir in the Computational Sensing and Imaging Lab.
My research spans image &amp;amp; signal processing, deep learning, and machine perception to solve challenging problems in autonomous systems. Generally, I&amp;rsquo;m curious about AI/ML &amp;amp; neuroscience, intelligent systems &amp;amp; robotics, and optimization &amp;amp; control.
Check out my projects to see what I&amp;rsquo;m working on, notes to see what I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about, and kū to see what I&amp;rsquo;m seeing!

 I graduated from Vanderbilt University in 2021 with a B.S. in computer science and neuroscience, minoring in applied math, and then again in 2022 with my M.S. in computer science. I was a student researcher in VISE MedICL advised by Prof. Ipek Oguz and my thesis was on a deep learning-enabled automatic segmentation system for surgical endoscopy.
I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about connecting with the broader community on topics of science and engineering. During undergrad, I was a mentor in the VUSE Design Studio. I was also a reviewer, section leader, and graduate mentor for the Vanderbilt Undergraduate Research Journal.
I have had the privilege to assist with courses on discrete structures, operating systems, deep learning, AI, and ML projects.
 I enjoy heavy weights, friendship, kū &amp;amp; photography, hendiadys, esports, kombucha, cucumber cocktails, and sunset runs.
I am an Anglophone &amp;gt; Lusophone &amp;gt; Hispanophone &amp;gt; Francophone. I self-studied Portuguese throughout high school, then I took a crucial gap year of emotional and linguistic growth in Lisbon, Portugal before undergrad.
My hometown is Austin, TX.
 I&amp;rsquo;m always open to new opportunities, especially those that align with my interests. You can contact me at &#43;1(512)547-7486 or zstoebner@my.utexas.edu.
