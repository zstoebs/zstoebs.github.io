      <description> &#x21BB; Hi, I&rsquo;m Zach.
I&rsquo;m an Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering PhD candidate at UT Austin working with Prof. Jon Tamir in the Computational Sensing &amp; Imaging Lab.
I&rsquo;m working on provably efficient, scalable, and robust algorithms for inverse problems. Generally, I&rsquo;m curious about AI/ML, signal processing, optimization, probability, statistics, and control.
I&rsquo;m always open to new opportunities and collaborations within my interests. You can contact me at zstoebner@austin.utexas.edu.

I graduated from Vanderbilt University in 2021, double majoring in computer science and neuroscience, minoring in applied math. I stayed an extra year to earn my M.S. in computer science in 2022. I was a student researcher in VISE MedICL advised by Prof. Ipek Oguz where I worked on computational neuroscience and deep learning methods for image processing. My awesome collaborators were Dr. Nick Kavoussi at VUMC, David Lu, and Kilian Hett.
I enjoy climbing, trail running, lifting, backpacking in the mountains, and kū &amp; tanka poetry and photography.
I am an Anglophone &gt; Lusophone &gt; Hispanophone &gt; Francophone.
My hometown is Austin, TX. I was born in Abilene, TX.
