      <description> Hi, I&#39;m Zach!  I leverage machine learning to solve challenging problems in neuroscience, computer vision, &amp;amp; intelligent systems. I&amp;rsquo;m currently a graduate student researcher in VISE MedICL at Vanderbilt University investigating applied ML for medical and neuroscientific data. Generally, I&amp;rsquo;m curious about ML &amp;amp; neuroscience, intelligent systems &amp;amp; robotics, and optimization &amp;amp; control theory.
Check out my projects to see what I&amp;rsquo;m working on, notes to see what I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about, and kū to see what I&amp;rsquo;m seeing!

 I graduated from Vandy in May 2021 with a B.S. in computer science and neuroscience, minoring in applied math. I expect to complete my M.S. in computer science, also at Vandy, in May 2022. Currently, I am applying to PhD programs that encourage interdisciplinary research at the intersection of my interests. Please reach out to me at &#43;15125477486 or zachary.a.stoebner@vanderbilt.edu if you would like to work with me!
During undergrad, I was a mentor in the VUSE Design Studio. I have had the privilege to assist with courses on discrete structures, operating systems, deep learning, and currently AI.
 Beyond research, I enjoy heavy weights, friendship, haiku &amp;amp; senryu, hendiadys, esports, kombucha, cucumber cocktails, and sunset runs. Occasionally, I take a good photo and write a kū to pair with it. I especially like to take shameless photoshoots of my cats, Amie and Chaussure.
I am a Lusophone &amp;gt; Hispanophone &amp;gt; Francophone. I self-studied Portuguese throughout high school, then I took a crucial gap year of emotional and linguistic growth in Lisbon, Portugal.
My hometown is Austin, TX, and I hope one day I can live there again as a scientist guiding the future of tech.
 I am always open to new opportunities, especially those that align with my interests. You can contact me at zachary.a.stoebner@vanderbilt.edu.
