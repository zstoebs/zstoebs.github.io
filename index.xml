      <description> Hi, I&#39;m Zach! I&amp;rsquo;m an Electrical &amp;amp; Computer Engineering PhD student at UT Austin working with Prof. Jon Tamir in the Computational Sensing and Imaging Lab.
My research focuses on computer vision for inverse problems in computational imaging. Specifically, I&amp;rsquo;m interested in developing generative and physics-informed models to improve image reconstruction in complex imaging systems. Generally, I&amp;rsquo;m curious about AI/ML &amp;amp; neuroscience, optimization &amp;amp; control, and intelligent systems &amp;amp; robotics.
Check out my projects to see what I&amp;rsquo;m working on, notes to see what I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about, and kū to see what I&amp;rsquo;m seeing!
I&amp;rsquo;m always open to new opportunities and collaborations within my interests. You can contact me at zstoebner@austin.utexas.edu.

I graduated from Vanderbilt University in 2021 with a B.S. in computer science and neuroscience, minoring in applied math, and then again in 2022 with my M.S. in computer science. I was a student researcher in VISE MedICL advised by Prof. Ipek Oguz.
I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about connecting with the broader community on topics of science and engineering. During undergrad, I was a mentor in the VUSE Design Studio. I was also a reviewer, section leader, and graduate mentor for the Vanderbilt Undergraduate Research Journal.
I have had the privilege to assist with courses on discrete structures, operating systems, deep learning, AI, and ML projects.
I enjoy kū &amp;amp; photography, hendiadys, esports, kombucha, cucumber cocktails, friendship, heavy weights, and trail runs.
I am an Anglophone &amp;gt; Lusophone &amp;gt; Hispanophone &amp;gt; Francophone. I self-studied Portuguese throughout high school, then I took a crucial gap year of personal and linguistic growth in Lisbon, Portugal before undergrad.
My hometown is Austin, TX.
