      <description> Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Zach.
I&amp;rsquo;m an Electrical &amp;amp; Computer Engineering PhD student at UT Austin working with Prof. Jon Tamir in the Computational Sensing &amp;amp; Imaging Lab.
My research interests span computational imaging &amp;amp; computer vision and machine learning &amp;amp; optimization. Currently, I am working on provable learning methods for solving inverse problems in Fourier imaging systems with an emphasis on magnetic resonance imaging. Generally, I&amp;rsquo;m curious about AI/ML &amp;amp; signal processing, optimization &amp;amp; control, and intelligent systems &amp;amp; robotics.
Check out my notes to see what I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about and kū to see what I&amp;rsquo;m seeing!
I&amp;rsquo;m always open to new opportunities and collaborations within my interests. You can contact me at zstoebner@austin.utexas.edu.

I graduated from Vanderbilt University in 2021 with a B.S. in computer science and neuroscience, minoring in applied math, and then again in 2022 with my M.S. in computer science. I was a student researcher in VISE MedICL advised by Prof. Ipek Oguz where I worked on computational neuroscience and deep learning methods for image processing. My awesome collaborators were Dr. Nick Kavoussi at VUMC and David Lu.
I enjoy tennis, heavy weights, trail running, climbing, backpacking in the mountains, kū &amp;amp; tanka poetry and photography, and hendiadys.
I am an Anglophone &amp;gt; Lusophone &amp;gt; Hispanophone &amp;gt; Francophone.
My hometown is Austin, TX. I was born in Abilene, TX.
